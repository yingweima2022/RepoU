## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**RepoU** is a âœ¨ Official implementation âœ¨ repository of paper "Alibaba LingmaAgent: Improving Automated Issue Resolution via Comprehensive Repository Exploration".

- Recently, Large Language Model (LLM) based agents have advanced the significant development of Automatic Software Engineering (ASE).
- We develop a novel ASE method named RepoUnderstander by guiding agents to comprehensively understand the whole repositories.
- It achieved 18.5% relative improvement on the SWE-bench Lite benchmark compared to SWE-agent.
