2024-05-08 11:03:50.320 | ERROR    | metagpt.utils.common:log_it:554 - Finished call to 'MCTS.Lingma.ask_llm_location_file.ChatGPT.get_reward' after 17.411(s), this was the 1st time calling it. exp: no score found for The issue reported involves a TypeError when writing an `Indexed` object to MathML using SymPy's `mathml` function. The error occurs because the `Indexed` object is not iterable, and this seems to happen during the conversion process where the code attempts to iterate over the `Indexed` object in the `_print_Basic` method of the `MathMLPrinter` class.

The provided code snippet:
```
# global_var method TENSORFLOW_DEFAULT in sympy/utilities/lambdify.py file
TENSORFLOW_DEFAULT = {}
```
is from the `lambdify.py` file in the SymPy package, specifically showing an empty dictionary definition for `TENSORFLOW_DEFAULT`. This code is unrelated to the issue reported because it deals with default settings for TensorFlow when using SymPy's `lambdify` function to convert SymPy expressions to TensorFlow expressions. The issue, however, is related to converting SymPy expressions into MathML format, which is a part of the MathML printing mechanism in SymPy and not related to the TensorFlow integration or the lambdify functionality.

To solve the reported issue, changes are needed in the `mathml.py` file where the MathMLPrinter's handling of `Indexed` objects should be examined and updated to correctly process `Indexed` objects without raising a TypeError. The correct place to look for modifications would involve the `_print_Basic` method or introducing a new print method specifically designed to handle `Indexed` objects within the `MathMLPrinter` class.

In conclusion, the probability score that the code (referring to the `TENSORFLOW_DEFAULT` definition in `lambdify.py`) needs to be modified to solve the issue of writing an `Indexed` object to MathML fails with a `TypeError` exception is `1`, as it is entirely unrelated to the issue described. The solution would instead involve modifications to the MathML printing functionalities within SymPy, specifically related to handling `Indexed` objects.
2024-05-08 13:43:35.704 | ERROR    | metagpt.utils.common:log_it:554 - Finished call to 'MCTS.Lingma.ask_llm_location_file.ChatGPT.get_reward' after 14.846(s), this was the 1st time calling it. exp: no score found for Given Issue: When using `evaluate(False)` within a context manager in sympy, an error occurs indicating "Imaginary coordinates are not permitted." This happens specifically when trying to use `Point2D` within the context. 

However, based on the issue description, the same commands executed outside the context manager or with `evaluate=False` passed directly as an argument do not raise any exceptions. 

The reported error originates from a ValueError thrown by the `Point` class in sympy's geometry module. The error suggests that the issue is associated with the instantiation or evaluation of objects when sympy's global evaluation setting is turned off. 

The provided code snippet from `sympy/utilities/misc.py` pertains to the `filldedent` function, which is a utility for string formatting and isn't directly involved in the evaluation process of sympy expressions or objects creation like `Point2D`. 

Evaluation control in sympy, especially the global control achieved by `with sp.evaluate(False):`, aims to suspend automatic simplification and transformation of expressions during their creation. The error and the context provided in the issue suggest a problem with how the Point2D object is being handled under these specific evaluation settings, most likely in the parsing, sympifying, or the geometry module itself, rather than with text or string manipulation functionality.

Looking into sympy’s geometry module, the instantiation of geometric objects like Point2D, or the sympy parsing and evaluation mechanisms would be more relevant areas to investigate for this issue. Modifications in `filldedent` wouldn't address the described problem because it doesn't interact with the evaluation process or the instantiation of geometric objects.

Result: Thus, the probability score that this code needs to be modified to solve this issue is **1**.
2024-05-08 14:37:02.440 | ERROR    | metagpt.utils.common:log_it:554 - Finished call to 'MCTS.Lingma.ask_llm_location_file.ChatGPT.get_reward' after 41.461(s), this was the 1st time calling it. exp: no score found for The issue described is about a display problem when using the `pretty_print` (or `pprint`) function from the `sympy` library to print objects, particularly those related to vector operations in the terminal. The problem reported indicates that the output becomes jumbled, specifically mentioning that the unit vector might be inaccurately placed within the output, causing confusion or incorrect representation of the mathematical expression.

The provided code snippet is part of the `stringPict` class in the `sympy`/`printing`/`pretty` module, specifically the `next` function. This function is crucial for arranging multiple `stringPict` objects next to each other in a coherent manner, ensuring that they are aligned correctly according to their baselines and have equal height for a proper display. The function is designed to handle the concatenation of string representations of mathematical objects, making it a central piece for correctly displaying complex mathematical expressions in a "pretty" format in the terminal.

Considering how the `pretty_print` function works, it heavily relies on correct implementations of functions like `next` to ensure the mathematical expressions are rendered accurately and understandably. The issue described seems to arise when the `pretty_print` function tries to display complex vector operations, which would inherently depend on the correct alignment and concatenation of string representations of the mathematical objects involved. If the `next` function fails to align these representations correctly, especially in complex scenarios involving multiple mathematical entities (like vectors and unit vectors in operations), it could lead to the described jumbled output.

However, without a direct indication that this specific part of the code is malfunctioning or causing the described display issue, and given that the description of the issue primarily involves the end behavior in the terminal, it's challenging to pinpoint this code as the definitive source of the problem without further analysis of how it interacts with vector objects during pretty printing.

Thus, given the central role of this function in arranging the printed output yet acknowledging the absence of explicit evidence linking it directly to the jumbled output described, the probability score that this code needs to be modified to solve the issue is estimated as 5.

Error arises from the methodology, as opposed to just a software bug. \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n```\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nfrom pvlib import scaling\r\ncs = np.random.rand(2**14)\r\nw, ts = scaling._compute_wavelet(cs,1)\r\nprint(np.all( (sum(w)-cs) < 1e-8 ))  # Returns False, expect True\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nFor a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) the sum of all wavelet modes should equate to the original data. \r\n\r\n**Versions:**\r\n - ``pvlib.__version__``: 0.7.2\r\n - ``pandas.__version__``: 1.2.3\r\n - python: 3.8.8\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThis bug is also present in the [PV_LIB](https://pvpmc.sandia.gov/applications/wavelet-variability-model/) Matlab version that was used as the basis for this code (I did reach out to them using the PVLIB MATLAB email form, but don't know who actually wrote that code). Essentially, the existing code throws away the highest level of Detail Coefficient in the transform and keeps an extra level of Approximation coefficient. The impact on the calculation is small, but leads to an incorrect DWT and reconstruction.

Error arises from the methodology, as opposed to just a software bug. \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n```\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nfrom pvlib import scaling\r\ncs = np.random.rand(2**14)\r\nw, ts = scaling._compute_wavelet(cs,1)\r\nprint(np.all( (sum(w)-cs) < 1e-8 ))  # Returns False, expect True\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nFor a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) the sum of all wavelet modes should equate to the original data. \r\n\r\n**Versions:**\r\n - ``pvlib.__version__``: 0.7.2\r\n - ``pandas.__version__``: 1.2.3\r\n - python: 3.8.8\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThis bug is also present in the [PV_LIB](https://pvpmc.sandia.gov/applications/wavelet-variability-model/) Matlab version that was used as the basis for this code (I did reach out to them using the PVLIB MATLAB email form, but don't know who actually wrote that code). Essentially, the existing code throws away the highest level of Detail Coefficient in the transform and keeps an extra level of Approximation coefficient. The impact on the calculation is small, but leads to an incorrect DWT and reconstruction. I have a fix that makes the code pass the theoretical test about the DWT proposed under 'To Reproduce' but there may be some question as to whether this should be corrected or left alone to match the MATLAB code it was based on.\nCode:\n```\n# top-level method _compute_wavelet in pvlib/scaling.py file\ndef _compute_wavelet(clearsky_index, dt=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute the wavelet transform on the input clear_sky time series.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    clearsky_index : numeric or pandas.Series\n        Clear Sky Index time series that will be smoothed.\n\n    dt : float, default None\n        The time series time delta.

If columns for ``'temp_air'`` and\n        ``'wind_speed'`` are not provided, air temperature of 20 C and wind\n        speed of 0 m/s are assumed.\n\n    Notes\n    -----\n    Assigns attributes: ``weather``, ``total_irrad``, ``solar_position``,\n    ``airmass``, ``aoi``.\n\n    See also\n    --------\n    pvlib.modelchain.ModelChain.prepare_inputs\n    \"\"\"\n\n    self._assign_weather(data)\n\n    self._verify_df(data, required=['poa_global', 'poa_direct',\n                                        'poa_diffuse'])\n    self._assign_total_irrad(data)\n\n    self._prep_inputs_solar_pos()\n    self._prep_inputs_airmass()\n\n    if isinstance(self.system, SingleAxisTracker):\n        self._prep_inputs_tracking()\n    else:\n        self._prep_inputs_fixed()\n\n    return self\n```\nThought: To solve the verification problem in the ModelChain.prepare_inputs() method mentioned in the issue, we do not need to modify the prepare_inputs_from_poa function, but should focus on ModelChain.prepare_inputs() itself. This is because the prepare_inputs_from_poa function and prepare_inputs() function handle different input data and verification logic.\nResult: Thus the probability score that this code needs to be modified to solve this issue is 1.\n\nIssue: Enable quiet mode/no-verbose in CLI for use in pre-commit hook\nThere seems to be only an option to increase the level of verbosity when using SQLFluff [CLI], not to limit it further.\r\n\r\nIt would be great to have an option to further limit the amount of prints when running `sqlfluff fix`, especially in combination with deployment using a pre-commit hook. For example, only print the return status and the number of fixes applied, similar to how it is when using `black` in a pre-commit hook:\r\n\r\nThis hides the potentially long list of fixes that are being applied to the SQL files, which can get quite verbose.\nCode:\n```\n# top-level method do_fixed in src/sqlfluff/cli/commands.py file\ndef do_fixes(lnt, result, formatter=None, **kwargs):\n    \"\"\"Actually do the fixes.\"\"\"\n    click.echo(\"Persisting Changes...\")\n    res = result.persist_changes(formatter=formatter, **kwargs)\n    if all(res.values()):\n        click.echo(\"Done. Please check your files to confirm.\")\n        return True\n    # If some failed then return false\n    click.echo(\n        \"Done. Some operations failed. Please check your files to confirm.\"\n    )  # pragma: no cover\n    click.echo(\n        \"Some errors cannot be fixed or there is another error blocking it.\"\n    )  # pragma: no cover\n    return False  # pragma: no cover\n```\nThought: Users hope to have an option to limit the amount of output information when using the sqlfluff fix command, similar to the output behavior when using black in the pre-commit hook. The purpose is to hide the long list of repairs applied when repairing SQL files, making the output more concise. In the do_fixes function, there are multiple click.echo() calls used to output progress and result messages on the command line. In response to the issue's request, which is to implement a silent mode with less or no output in the CLI, it is necessary to modify this function so that the output can be controlled and the information will only be displayed when necessary.

If columns for ``'temp_air'`` and\n        ``'wind_speed'`` are not provided, air temperature of 20 C and wind\n        speed of 0 m/s are assumed.\n\n    Notes\n    -----\n    Assigns attributes: ``weather``, ``total_irrad``, ``solar_position``,\n    ``airmass``, ``aoi``.\n\n    See also\n    --------\n    pvlib.modelchain.ModelChain.prepare_inputs\n    \"\"\"\n\n    self._assign_weather(data)\n\n    self._verify_df(data, required=['poa_global', 'poa_direct',\n                                        'poa_diffuse'])\n    self._assign_total_irrad(data)\n\n    self._prep_inputs_solar_pos()\n    self._prep_inputs_airmass()\n\n    if isinstance(self.system, SingleAxisTracker):\n        self._prep_inputs_tracking()\n    else:\n        self._prep_inputs_fixed()\n\n    return self\n```\nThought: To solve the verification problem in the ModelChain.prepare_inputs() method mentioned in the issue, we do not need to modify the prepare_inputs_from_poa function, but should focus on ModelChain.prepare_inputs() itself. This is because the prepare_inputs_from_poa function and prepare_inputs() function handle different input data and verification logic.\nResult: Thus the probability score that this code needs to be modified to solve this issue is 1.\n\nIssue: Enable quiet mode/no-verbose in CLI for use in pre-commit hook\nThere seems to be only an option to increase the level of verbosity when using SQLFluff [CLI], not to limit it further.\r\n\r\nIt would be great to have an option to further limit the amount of prints when running `sqlfluff fix`, especially in combination with deployment using a pre-commit hook. For example, only print the return status and the number of fixes applied, similar to how it is when using `black` in a pre-commit hook:\r\n\r\nThis hides the potentially long list of fixes that are being applied to the SQL files, which can get quite verbose.\nCode:\n```\n# top-level method do_fixed in src/sqlfluff/cli/commands.py file\ndef do_fixes(lnt, result, formatter=None, **kwargs):\n    \"\"\"Actually do the fixes.\"\"\"\n    click.echo(\"Persisting Changes...\")\n    res = result.persist_changes(formatter=formatter, **kwargs)\n    if all(res.values()):\n        click.echo(\"Done.

Please check your files to confirm.\"\n    )  # pragma: no cover\n    click.echo(\n        \"Some errors cannot be fixed or there is another error blocking it.\"\n    )  # pragma: no cover\n    return False  # pragma: no cover\n```\nThought: Users hope to have an option to limit the amount of output information when using the sqlfluff fix command, similar to the output behavior when using black in the pre-commit hook. The purpose is to hide the long list of repairs applied when repairing SQL files, making the output more concise. In the do_fixes function, there are multiple click.echo() calls used to output progress and result messages on the command line. In response to the issue's request, which is to implement a silent mode with less or no output in the CLI, it is necessary to modify this function so that the output can be controlled and the information will only be displayed when necessary. It should be noted that other related functions may need to be modified.\nResult: Thus the probability score that this code needs to be modified to solve this issue is 8.\n\nIssue: Bug within scaling.py wavelet calculation methodology\n**Describe the bug**\r\nMathematical error within the wavelet computation for the scaling.py WVM implementation. Error arises from the methodology, as opposed to just a software bug. \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n```\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nfrom pvlib import scaling\r\ncs = np.random.rand(2**14)\r\nw, ts = scaling._compute_wavelet(cs,1)\r\nprint(np.all( (sum(w)-cs) < 1e-8 ))  # Returns False, expect True\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nFor a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) the sum of all wavelet modes should equate to the original data. \r\n\r\n**Versions:**\r\n - ``pvlib.__version__``: 0.7.2\r\n - ``pandas.__version__``: 1.2.3\r\n - python: 3.8.8\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThis bug is also present in the [PV_LIB](https://pvpmc.sandia.gov/applications/wavelet-variability-model/) Matlab version that was used as the basis for this code (I did reach out to them using the PVLIB MATLAB email form, but don't know who actually wrote that code). Essentially, the existing code throws away the highest level of Detail Coefficient in the transform and keeps an extra level of Approximation coefficient. The impact on the calculation is small, but leads to an incorrect DWT and reconstruction. I have a fix that makes the code pass the theoretical test about the DWT proposed under 'To Reproduce' but there may be some question as to whether this should be corrected or left alone to match the MATLAB code it was based on.\nCode:\n```\n# top-level method _compute_wavelet in pvlib/scaling.py file\ndef _compute_wavelet(clearsky_index, dt=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute the wavelet transform on the input clear_sky time series.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    clearsky_index : numeric or pandas.Series\n        Clear Sky Index time series that will be smoothed.\n\n    dt : float, default None\n        The time series time delta.

Theoretically, for discrete wavelet transform (DWT), the sum of all wavelet modes should be equal to the original data.

Considering the results and the feedback from Mr.Kalevi Suominen, our proposal is that the mignotte_bound should be replaced by the knuth-cohen bound.\nAlso, `dmp_zz_mignotte_bound(f, u, K)` for mutli-variants polynomials should be replaced appropriately.\n</issue>\nCode:\n```\n# top-level function method rewrite in sympy/series/gruntz.py file\ndef rewrite(e, Omega, x, wsym):\n    \"\"\"e(x) ... the function\n    Omega ... the mrv set\n    wsym ... the symbol which is going to be used for w\n\n    Returns the rewritten e in terms of w and log(w).

This is because the prepare_inputs_from_poa function and prepare_inputs() function handle different input data and verification logic.\nResult: Thus the probability score that this code needs to be modified to solve this issue is 1.\n\nIssue: Enable quiet mode/no-verbose in CLI for use in pre-commit hook\nThere seems to be only an option to increase the level of verbosity when using SQLFluff [CLI], not to limit it further.\r\n\r\nIt would be great to have an option to further limit the amount of prints when running `sqlfluff fix`, especially in combination with deployment using a pre-commit hook. For example, only print the return status and the number of fixes applied, similar to how it is when using `black` in a pre-commit hook:\r\n\r\nThis hides the potentially long list of fixes that are being applied to the SQL files, which can get quite verbose.\nCode:\n```\n# top-level method do_fixed in src/sqlfluff/cli/commands.py file\ndef do_fixes(lnt, result, formatter=None, **kwargs):\n    \"\"\"Actually do the fixes.\"\"\"\n    click.echo(\"Persisting Changes...\")\n    res = result.persist_changes(formatter=formatter, **kwargs)\n    if all(res.values()):\n        click.echo(\"Done.

Please check your files to confirm.\"\n    )  # pragma: no cover\n    click.echo(\n        \"Some errors cannot be fixed or there is another error blocking it.\"\n    )  # pragma: no cover\n    return False  # pragma: no cover\n```\nThought: Users hope to have an option to limit the amount of output information when using the sqlfluff fix command, similar to the output behavior when using black in the pre-commit hook. The purpose is to hide the long list of repairs applied when repairing SQL files, making the output more concise. In the do_fixes function, there are multiple click.echo() calls used to output progress and result messages on the command line. In response to the issue's request, which is to implement a silent mode with less or no output in the CLI, it is necessary to modify this function so that the output can be controlled and the information will only be displayed when necessary. It should be noted that other related functions may need to be modified.\nResult: Thus the probability score that this code needs to be modified to solve this issue is 8.\n\nIssue: Bug within scaling.py wavelet calculation methodology\n**Describe the bug**\r\nMathematical error within the wavelet computation for the scaling.py WVM implementation. Error arises from the methodology, as opposed to just a software bug. \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n```\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nfrom pvlib import scaling\r\ncs = np.random.rand(2**14)\r\nw, ts = scaling._compute_wavelet(cs,1)\r\nprint(np.all( (sum(w)-cs) < 1e-8 ))  # Returns False, expect True\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nFor a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) the sum of all wavelet modes should equate to the original data. \r\n\r\n**Versions:**\r\n - ``pvlib.__version__``: 0.7.2\r\n - ``pandas.__version__``: 1.2.3\r\n - python: 3.8.8\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThis bug is also present in the [PV_LIB](https://pvpmc.sandia.gov/applications/wavelet-variability-model/) Matlab version that was used as the basis for this code (I did reach out to them using the PVLIB MATLAB email form, but don't know who actually wrote that code). Essentially, the existing code throws away the highest level of Detail Coefficient in the transform and keeps an extra level of Approximation coefficient. The impact on the calculation is small, but leads to an incorrect DWT and reconstruction. I have a fix that makes the code pass the theoretical test about the DWT proposed under 'To Reproduce' but there may be some question as to whether this should be corrected or left alone to match the MATLAB code it was based on.\nCode:\n```\n# top-level method _compute_wavelet in pvlib/scaling.py file\ndef _compute_wavelet(clearsky_index, dt=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute the wavelet transform on the input clear_sky time series.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    clearsky_index : numeric or pandas.Series\n        Clear Sky Index time series that will be smoothed.\n\n    dt : float, default None\n        The time series time delta.

Theoretically, for discrete wavelet transform (DWT), the sum of all wavelet modes should be equal to the original data. However, during testing it was found that this reconstruction condition was not met.

Essentially, the existing code throws away the highest level of Detail Coefficient in the transform and keeps an extra level of Approximation coefficient. The impact on the calculation is small, but leads to an incorrect DWT and reconstruction. I have a fix that makes the code pass the theoretical test about the DWT proposed under 'To Reproduce' but there may be some question as to whether this should be corrected or left alone to match the MATLAB code it was based on.\nCode:\n```\n# top-level method _compute_wavelet in pvlib/scaling.py file\ndef _compute_wavelet(clearsky_index, dt=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute the wavelet transform on the input clear_sky time series.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    clearsky_index : numeric or pandas.Series\n        Clear Sky Index time series that will be smoothed.\n\n    dt : float, default None\n        The time series time delta.

Theoretically, for discrete wavelet transform (DWT), the sum of all wavelet modes should be equal to the original data. However, during testing it was found that this reconstruction condition was not met. To resolve this issue, a fundamental change in the implementation of the _compute_wavelet function is required.\nResult: Thus the probability score that this code needs to be modified to solve this issue is 10.\n\n# Now the issue is:\n<issue>sympy.polys.factortools.dmp_zz_mignotte_bound improvement\nThe method `dup_zz_mignotte_bound(f, K)` can be significantly improved by using the **Knuth-Cohen bound** instead.

Theoretically, for discrete wavelet transform (DWT), the sum of all wavelet modes should be equal to the original data. However, during testing it was found that this reconstruction condition was not met. To resolve this issue, a fundamental change in the implementation of the _compute_wavelet function is required.\nResult: Thus the probability score that this code needs to be modified to solve this issue is 10.\n\n# Now the issue is:\n<issue>sympy.polys.factortools.dmp_zz_mignotte_bound improvement\nThe method `dup_zz_mignotte_bound(f, K)` can be significantly improved by using the **Knuth-Cohen bound** instead. After our research with Prof. Ag.Akritas we have implemented the Knuth-Cohen bound among others, and compare them among dozens of polynomials with different degree, density and coefficients range. Considering the results and the feedback from Mr.Kalevi Suominen, our proposal is that the mignotte_bound should be replaced by the knuth-cohen bound.\nAlso, `dmp_zz_mignotte_bound(f, u, K)` for mutli-variants polynomials should be replaced appropriately.\n</issue>\nCode:\n```\n# top-level function method get_contraction_structure in sympy/tensor/index_methods.py file\ndef get_contraction_structure(expr):\n    \"\"\"Determine dummy indices of ``expr`` and describe its structure\n\n    By *dummy* we mean indices that are summation indices.\n\n    The structure of the expression is determined and described as follows:\n\n    1) A conforming summation of Indexed objects is described with a dict where\n       the keys are summation indices and the corresponding values are sets\n       containing all terms for which the summation applies.  All Add objects\n       in the SymPy expression tree are described like this.\n\n    2) For all nodes in the SymPy expression tree that are *not* of type Add, the\n       following applies:\n\n       If a node discovers contractions in one of its arguments, the node\n       itself will be stored as a key in the dict.  For that key, the\n       corresponding value is a list of dicts, each of which is the result of a\n       recursive call to get_contraction_structure().  The list contains only\n       dicts for the non-trivial deeper contractions, omitting dicts with None\n       as the one and only key.\n\n    .. Note:: The presence of expressions among the dictionary keys indicates\n       multiple levels of index contractions.  A nested dict displays nested\n       contractions and may itself contain dicts from a deeper level.  In\n       practical calculations the summation in the deepest nested level must be\n       calculated first so that the outer expression can access the resulting\n       indexed object.\n\n    Examples\n    ========\n\n    >>> from sympy.tensor.index_methods import get_contraction_structure\n    >>> from sympy import symbols, default_sort_key\n    >>> from sympy.tensor import IndexedBase, Idx\n    >>> x, y, A = map(IndexedBase, ['x', 'y', 'A'])\n    >>> i, j, k, l = map(Idx, ['i', 'j', 'k', 'l'])\n    >>> get_contraction_structure(x[i]*y[i] + A[j, j])\n    {(i,): {x[i]*y[i]}, (j,): {A[j, j]}}\n    >>> get_contraction_structure(x[i]*y[j])\n    {None: {x[i]*y[j]}}\n\n    A multiplication of contracted factors results in nested dicts representing\n    the internal contractions.\n\n    >>> d = get_contraction_structure(x[i, i]*y[j, j])\n    >>> sorted(d.keys(), key=default_sort_key)\n    [None, x[i, i]*y[j, j]]\n\n    In this case, the product has no contractions:\n\n    >>> d[None]\n    {x[i, i]*y[j, j]}\n\n    Factors are contracted \"first\":\n\n    >>> sorted(d[x[i, i]*y[j, j]], key=default_sort_key)\n    [{(i,): {x[i, i]}}, {(j,): {y[j, j]}}]\n\n    A parenthesized Add object is also returned as a nested dictionary.  The\n    term containing the parenthesis is a Mul with a contraction among the\n    arguments, so it will be found as a key in the result.  It stores the\n    dictionary resulting from a recursive call on the Add expression.\n\n    >>> d = get_contraction_structure(x[i]*(y[i] + A[i, j]*x[j]))\n    >>> sorted(d.keys(), key=default_sort_key)\n    [(A[i, j]*x[j] + y[i])*x[i], (i,)]\n    >>> d[(i,)]\n    {(A[i, j]*x[j] + y[i])*x[i]}\n    >>> d[x[i]*(A[i, j]*x[j] + y[i])]\n    [{None: {y[i]}, (j,): {A[i, j]*x[j]}}]\n\n    Powers with contractions in either base or exponent will also be found as\n    keys in the dictionary, mapping to a list of results from recursive calls:\n\n    >>> d = get_contraction_structure(A[j, j]**A[i, i])\n    >>> d[None]\n    {A[j, j]**A[i, i]}\n    >>> nested_contractions = d[A[j, j]**A[i, i]]\n    >>> nested_contractions[0]\n    {(j,): {A[j, j]}}\n    >>> nested_contractions[1]\n    {(i,): {A[i, i]}}\n\n    The description of the contraction structure may appear complicated when\n    represented with a string in the above examples, but it is easy to iterate\n    over:\n\n    >>> from sympy import Expr\n    >>> for key in d:\n    ...     if isinstance(key, Expr):\n    ...         continue\n    ...     for term in d[key]:\n    ...         if term in d:\n    ...             # treat deepest contraction first\n    ...             pass\n    ...     # treat outermost contactions here\n\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # We call ourself recursively to inspect sub expressions.\n\n    if isinstance(expr, Indexed):\n        junk, key = _remove_repeated(expr.indices)\n        return {key or None: {expr}}\n    elif expr.is_Atom:\n        return {None: {expr}}\n    elif expr.is_Mul:\n        junk, junk, key = _get_indices_Mul(expr, return_dummies=True)\n        result = {key or None: {expr}}\n        # recurse on every factor\n        nested = []\n        for fac in expr.args:\n            facd = get_contraction_structure(fac)\n            if not (None in facd and len(facd) == 1):\n                nested.append(facd)\n        if nested:\n            result[expr] = nested\n        return result\n    elif expr.is_Pow or isinstance(expr, exp):\n        # recurse in base and exp separately.

For example, only print the return status and the number of fixes applied, similar to how it is when using `black` in a pre-commit hook:\r\n\r\nThis hides the potentially long list of fixes that are being applied to the SQL files, which can get quite verbose.\nCode:\n```\n# top-level method do_fixed in src/sqlfluff/cli/commands.py file\ndef do_fixes(lnt, result, formatter=None, **kwargs):\n    \"\"\"Actually do the fixes.\"\"\"\n    click.echo(\"Persisting Changes...\")\n    res = result.persist_changes(formatter=formatter, **kwargs)\n    if all(res.values()):\n        click.echo(\"Done.

The purpose is to hide the long list of repairs applied when repairing SQL files, making the output more concise. In the do_fixes function, there are multiple click.echo() calls used to output progress and result messages on the command line. In response to the issue's request, which is to implement a silent mode with less or no output in the CLI, it is necessary to modify this function so that the output can be controlled and the information will only be displayed when necessary. It should be noted that other related functions may need to be modified.\nResult: Thus the probability score that this code needs to be modified to solve this issue is 8.\n\nIssue: Bug within scaling.py wavelet calculation methodology\n**Describe the bug**\r\nMathematical error within the wavelet computation for the scaling.py WVM implementation. Error arises from the methodology, as opposed to just a software bug. \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n```\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nfrom pvlib import scaling\r\ncs = np.random.rand(2**14)\r\nw, ts = scaling._compute_wavelet(cs,1)\r\nprint(np.all( (sum(w)-cs) < 1e-8 ))  # Returns False, expect True\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nFor a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) the sum of all wavelet modes should equate to the original data. \r\n\r\n**Versions:**\r\n - ``pvlib.__version__``: 0.7.2\r\n - ``pandas.__version__``: 1.2.3\r\n - python: 3.8.8\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThis bug is also present in the [PV_LIB](https://pvpmc.sandia.gov/applications/wavelet-variability-model/) Matlab version that was used as the basis for this code (I did reach out to them using the PVLIB MATLAB email form, but don't know who actually wrote that code). Essentially, the existing code throws away the highest level of Detail Coefficient in the transform and keeps an extra level of Approximation coefficient. The impact on the calculation is small, but leads to an incorrect DWT and reconstruction.

Lambda() is only used (instead of lambda) to make\n        them easier to test and debug. Note that Tfuncs corresponds to the\n        elements of T, except for T[0] == x, but they should be back-substituted\n        in reverse order.  backsubs is a (possibly empty) back-substitution list\n        that should be applied on the completed integral to make it look more\n        like the original integrand.\n\n        If it is unsuccessful, it raises NotImplementedError.\n\n        You can also create an object by manually setting the attributes as a\n        dictionary to the extension keyword argument.

This is because the prepare_inputs_from_poa function and prepare_inputs() function handle different input data and verification logic.\nResult: Thus the probability score that this code needs to be modified to solve this issue is 1.\n\nIssue: Enable quiet mode/no-verbose in CLI for use in pre-commit hook\nThere seems to be only an option to increase the level of verbosity when using SQLFluff [CLI], not to limit it further.\r\n\r\nIt would be great to have an option to further limit the amount of prints when running `sqlfluff fix`, especially in combination with deployment using a pre-commit hook. For example, only print the return status and the number of fixes applied, similar to how it is when using `black` in a pre-commit hook:\r\n\r\nThis hides the potentially long list of fixes that are being applied to the SQL files, which can get quite verbose.\nCode:\n```\n# top-level method do_fixed in src/sqlfluff/cli/commands.py file\ndef do_fixes(lnt, result, formatter=None, **kwargs):\n    \"\"\"Actually do the fixes.\"\"\"\n    click.echo(\"Persisting Changes...\")\n    res = result.persist_changes(formatter=formatter, **kwargs)\n    if all(res.values()):\n        click.echo(\"Done.

The purpose is to hide the long list of repairs applied when repairing SQL files, making the output more concise. In the do_fixes function, there are multiple click.echo() calls used to output progress and result messages on the command line. In response to the issue's request, which is to implement a silent mode with less or no output in the CLI, it is necessary to modify this function so that the output can be controlled and the information will only be displayed when necessary. It should be noted that other related functions may need to be modified.\nResult: Thus the probability score that this code needs to be modified to solve this issue is 8.\n\nIssue: Bug within scaling.py wavelet calculation methodology\n**Describe the bug**\r\nMathematical error within the wavelet computation for the scaling.py WVM implementation. Error arises from the methodology, as opposed to just a software bug. \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n```\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nfrom pvlib import scaling\r\ncs = np.random.rand(2**14)\r\nw, ts = scaling._compute_wavelet(cs,1)\r\nprint(np.all( (sum(w)-cs) < 1e-8 ))  # Returns False, expect True\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nFor a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) the sum of all wavelet modes should equate to the original data. \r\n\r\n**Versions:**\r\n - ``pvlib.__version__``: 0.7.2\r\n - ``pandas.__version__``: 1.2.3\r\n - python: 3.8.8\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThis bug is also present in the [PV_LIB](https://pvpmc.sandia.gov/applications/wavelet-variability-model/) Matlab version that was used as the basis for this code (I did reach out to them using the PVLIB MATLAB email form, but don't know who actually wrote that code). Essentially, the existing code throws away the highest level of Detail Coefficient in the transform and keeps an extra level of Approximation coefficient. The impact on the calculation is small, but leads to an incorrect DWT and reconstruction. I have a fix that makes the code pass the theoretical test about the DWT proposed under 'To Reproduce' but there may be some question as to whether this should be corrected or left alone to match the MATLAB code it was based on.\nCode:\n```\n# top-level method _compute_wavelet in pvlib/scaling.py file\ndef _compute_wavelet(clearsky_index, dt=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute the wavelet transform on the input clear_sky time series.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    clearsky_index : numeric or pandas.Series\n        Clear Sky Index time series that will be smoothed.\n\n    dt : float, default None\n        The time series time delta.

Theoretically, for discrete wavelet transform (DWT), the sum of all wavelet modes should be equal to the original data. However, during testing it was found that this reconstruction condition was not met. To resolve this issue, a fundamental change in the implementation of the _compute_wavelet function is required.\nResult: Thus the probability score that this code needs to be modified to solve this issue is 10.\n\n# Now the issue is:\n<issue>sympy.polys.factortools.dmp_zz_mignotte_bound improvement\nThe method `dup_zz_mignotte_bound(f, K)` can be significantly improved by using the **Knuth-Cohen bound** instead.

If this is not desired or causes\n        problems, ``simultaneous`` can be set to False.\n\n        In addition, if an expression containing more than one Wild symbol\n        is being used to match subexpressions and the ``exact`` flag is None\n        it will be set to True so the match will only succeed if all non-zero\n        values are received for each Wild that appears in the match pattern.\n        Setting this to False accepts a match of 0; while setting it True\n        accepts all matches that have a 0 in them. See example below for\n        cautions.\n\n        The list of possible combinations of queries and replacement values\n        is listed below:\n\n        Examples\n        ========\n\n        Initial setup\n\n        >>> from sympy import log, sin, cos, tan, Wild, Mul, Add\n        >>> from sympy.abc import x, y\n        >>> f = log(sin(x)) + tan(sin(x**2))\n\n        1.1. type -> type\n            obj.replace(type, newtype)\n\n            When object of type ``type`` is found, replace it with the\n            result of passing its argument(s) to ``newtype``.\n\n            >>> f.replace(sin, cos)\n            log(cos(x)) + tan(cos(x**2))\n            >>> sin(x).replace(sin, cos, map=True)\n            (cos(x), {sin(x): cos(x)})\n            >>> (x*y).replace(Mul, Add)\n            x + y\n\n        1.2. type -> func\n            obj.replace(type, func)\n\n            When object of type ``type`` is found, apply ``func`` to its\n            argument(s). ``func`` must be written to handle the number\n            of arguments of ``type``.\n\n            >>> f.replace(sin, lambda arg: sin(2*arg))\n            log(sin(2*x)) + tan(sin(2*x**2))\n            >>> (x*y).replace(Mul, lambda *args: sin(2*Mul(*args)))\n            sin(2*x*y)\n\n        2.1. pattern -> expr\n            obj.replace(pattern(wild), expr(wild))\n\n            Replace subexpressions matching ``pattern`` with the expression\n            written in terms of the Wild symbols in ``pattern``.\n\n            >>> a, b = map(Wild, 'ab')\n            >>> f.replace(sin(a), tan(a))\n            log(tan(x)) + tan(tan(x**2))\n            >>> f.replace(sin(a), tan(a/2))\n            log(tan(x/2)) + tan(tan(x**2/2))\n            >>> f.replace(sin(a), a)\n            log(x) + tan(x**2)\n            >>> (x*y).replace(a*x, a)\n            y\n\n            Matching is exact by default when more than one Wild symbol\n            is used: matching fails unless the match gives non-zero\n            values for all Wild symbols:\n\n            >>> (2*x + y).replace(a*x + b, b - a)\n            y - 2\n            >>> (2*x).replace(a*x + b, b - a)\n            2*x\n\n            When set to False, the results may be non-intuitive:\n\n            >>> (2*x).replace(a*x + b, b - a, exact=False)\n            2/x\n\n        2.2. pattern -> func\n            obj.replace(pattern(wild), lambda wild: expr(wild))\n\n            All behavior is the same as in 2.1 but now a function in terms of\n            pattern variables is used rather than an expression:\n\n            >>> f.replace(sin(a), lambda a: sin(2*a))\n            log(sin(2*x)) + tan(sin(2*x**2))\n\n        3.1. func -> func\n            obj.replace(filter, func)\n\n            Replace subexpression ``e`` with ``func(e)`` if ``filter(e)``\n            is True.\n\n            >>> g = 2*sin(x**3)\n            >>> g.replace(lambda expr: expr.is_Number, lambda expr: expr**2)\n            4*sin(x**9)\n\n        The expression itself is also targeted by the query but is done in\n        such a fashion that changes are not made twice.\n\n            >>> e = x*(x*y + 1)\n            >>> e.replace(lambda x: x.is_Mul, lambda x: 2*x)\n            2*x*(2*x*y + 1)\n\n        When matching a single symbol, `exact` will default to True, but\n        this may or may not be the behavior that is desired:\n\n        Here, we want `exact=False`:\n\n        >>> from sympy import Function\n        >>> f = Function('f')\n        >>> e = f(1) + f(0)\n        >>> q = f(a), lambda a: f(a + 1)\n        >>> e.replace(*q, exact=False)\n        f(1) + f(2)\n        >>> e.replace(*q, exact=True)\n        f(0) + f(2)\n\n        But here, the nature of matching makes selecting\n        the right setting tricky:\n\n        >>> e = x**(1 + y)\n        >>> (x**(1 + y)).replace(x**(1 + a), lambda a: x**-a, exact=False)\n        1\n        >>> (x**(1 + y)).replace(x**(1 + a), lambda a: x**-a, exact=True)\n        x**(-x - y + 1)\n        >>> (x**y).replace(x**(1 + a), lambda a: x**-a, exact=False)\n        1\n        >>> (x**y).replace(x**(1 + a), lambda a: x**-a, exact=True)\n        x**(1 - y)\n\n        It is probably better to use a different form of the query\n        that describes the target expression more precisely:\n\n        >>> (1 + x**(1 + y)).replace(\n        ... lambda x: x.is_Pow and x.exp.is_Add and x.exp.args[0] == 1,\n        ... lambda x: x.base**(1 - (x.exp - 1)))\n        ...\n        x**(1 - y) + 1\n\n        See Also\n        ========\n\n        subs: substitution of subexpressions as defined by the objects\n              themselves.\n        xreplace: exact node replacement in expr tree;

Then at the last line conclude \"Thus the probability score that this code needs to be modified to solve this issue is s\", where s is an integer between 1 and 10.\n\n# Examples\nIssue: ModelChain.prepare_inputs can succeed with missing dhi\nFrom the docstring for `ModelChain.prepare_inputs()` I believe the method should fail if `weather` does not have a `dhi` column.\r\n\r\nThe validation checks for `'ghi'` twice, but not `'dhi`.\nCode: \n```\n# class-function method prepare_inputs_from_poa in pvlib/modelchain.py\ndef prepare_inputs_from_poa(self, data):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prepare the solar position, irradiance and weather inputs to\n    the model, starting with plane-of-array irradiance.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    data : DataFrame\n        Contains plane-of-array irradiance data. Required column names\n        include ``'poa_global'``, ``'poa_direct'`` and ``'poa_diffuse'``.\n        Columns with weather-related data are ssigned to the\n        ``weather`` attribute.  If columns for ``'temp_air'`` and\n        ``'wind_speed'`` are not provided, air temperature of 20 C and wind\n        speed of 0 m/s are assumed.\n\n    Notes\n    -----\n    Assigns attributes: ``weather``, ``total_irrad``, ``solar_position``,\n    ``airmass``, ``aoi``.\n\n    See also\n    --------\n    pvlib.modelchain.ModelChain.prepare_inputs\n    \"\"\"\n\n    self._assign_weather(data)\n\n    self._verify_df(data, required=['poa_global', 'poa_direct',\n                                        'poa_diffuse'])\n    self._assign_total_irrad(data)\n\n    self._prep_inputs_solar_pos()\n    self._prep_inputs_airmass()\n\n    if isinstance(self.system, SingleAxisTracker):\n        self._prep_inputs_tracking()\n    else:\n        self._prep_inputs_fixed()\n\n    return self\n```\nThought: To solve the verification problem in the ModelChain.prepare_inputs() method mentioned in the issue, we do not need to modify the prepare_inputs_from_poa function, but should focus on ModelChain.prepare_inputs() itself. This is because the prepare_inputs_from_poa function and prepare_inputs() function handle different input data and verification logic.\nResult: Thus the probability score that this code needs to be modified to solve this issue is 1.\n\nIssue: Enable quiet mode/no-verbose in CLI for use in pre-commit hook\nThere seems to be only an option to increase the level of verbosity when using SQLFluff [CLI], not to limit it further.\r\n\r\nIt would be great to have an option to further limit the amount of prints when running `sqlfluff fix`, especially in combination with deployment using a pre-commit hook. For example, only print the return status and the number of fixes applied, similar to how it is when using `black` in a pre-commit hook:\r\n\r\nThis hides the potentially long list of fixes that are being applied to the SQL files, which can get quite verbose.\nCode:\n```\n# top-level method do_fixed in src/sqlfluff/cli/commands.py file\ndef do_fixes(lnt, result, formatter=None, **kwargs):\n    \"\"\"Actually do the fixes.\"\"\"\n    click.echo(\"Persisting Changes...\")\n    res = result.persist_changes(formatter=formatter, **kwargs)\n    if all(res.values()):\n        click.echo(\"Done.

Please check your files to confirm.\"\n    )  # pragma: no cover\n    click.echo(\n        \"Some errors cannot be fixed or there is another error blocking it.\"\n    )  # pragma: no cover\n    return False  # pragma: no cover\n```\nThought: Users hope to have an option to limit the amount of output information when using the sqlfluff fix command, similar to the output behavior when using black in the pre-commit hook. The purpose is to hide the long list of repairs applied when repairing SQL files, making the output more concise. In the do_fixes function, there are multiple click.echo() calls used to output progress and result messages on the command line. In response to the issue's request, which is to implement a silent mode with less or no output in the CLI, it is necessary to modify this function so that the output can be controlled and the information will only be displayed when necessary. It should be noted that other related functions may need to be modified.\nResult: Thus the probability score that this code needs to be modified to solve this issue is 8.\n\nIssue: Bug within scaling.py wavelet calculation methodology\n**Describe the bug**\r\nMathematical error within the wavelet computation for the scaling.py WVM implementation. Error arises from the methodology, as opposed to just a software bug. \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n```\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nfrom pvlib import scaling\r\ncs = np.random.rand(2**14)\r\nw, ts = scaling._compute_wavelet(cs,1)\r\nprint(np.all( (sum(w)-cs) < 1e-8 ))  # Returns False, expect True\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nFor a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) the sum of all wavelet modes should equate to the original data. \r\n\r\n**Versions:**\r\n - ``pvlib.__version__``: 0.7.2\r\n - ``pandas.__version__``: 1.2.3\r\n - python: 3.8.8\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThis bug is also present in the [PV_LIB](https://pvpmc.sandia.gov/applications/wavelet-variability-model/) Matlab version that was used as the basis for this code (I did reach out to them using the PVLIB MATLAB email form, but don't know who actually wrote that code). Essentially, the existing code throws away the highest level of Detail Coefficient in the transform and keeps an extra level of Approximation coefficient. The impact on the calculation is small, but leads to an incorrect DWT and reconstruction. I have a fix that makes the code pass the theoretical test about the DWT proposed under 'To Reproduce' but there may be some question as to whether this should be corrected or left alone to match the MATLAB code it was based on.\nCode:\n```\n# top-level method _compute_wavelet in pvlib/scaling.py file\ndef _compute_wavelet(clearsky_index, dt=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute the wavelet transform on the input clear_sky time series.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    clearsky_index : numeric or pandas.Series\n        Clear Sky Index time series that will be smoothed.\n\n    dt : float, default None\n        The time series time delta.

Theoretically, for discrete wavelet transform (DWT), the sum of all wavelet modes should be equal to the original data. However, during testing it was found that this reconstruction condition was not met. To resolve this issue, a fundamental change in the implementation of the _compute_wavelet function is required.\nResult: Thus the probability score that this code needs to be modified to solve this issue is 10.\n\n# Now the issue is:\n<issue>sympy.polys.factortools.dmp_zz_mignotte_bound improvement\nThe method `dup_zz_mignotte_bound(f, K)` can be significantly improved by using the **Knuth-Cohen bound** instead. After our research with Prof. Ag.Akritas we have implemented the Knuth-Cohen bound among others, and compare them among dozens of polynomials with different degree, density and coefficients range. Considering the results and the feedback from Mr.Kalevi Suominen, our proposal is that the mignotte_bound should be replaced by the knuth-cohen bound.\nAlso, `dmp_zz_mignotte_bound(f, u, K)` for mutli-variants polynomials should be replaced appropriately.\n</issue>\nCode:\n```\n# top-level function method trigsimp_groebner in sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py file\ndef trigsimp_groebner(expr, hints=[], quick=False, order=\"grlex\",\n                      polynomial=False):\n    \"\"\"\n    Simplify trigonometric expressions using a groebner basis algorithm.\n\n    This routine takes a fraction involving trigonometric or hyperbolic\n    expressions, and tries to simplify it. The primary metric is the\n    total degree. Some attempts are made to choose the simplest possible\n    expression of the minimal degree, but this is non-rigorous, and also\n    very slow (see the ``quick=True`` option).\n\n    If ``polynomial`` is set to True, instead of simplifying numerator and\n    denominator together, this function just brings numerator and denominator\n    into a canonical form. This is much faster, but has potentially worse\n    results. However, if the input is a polynomial, then the result is\n    guaranteed to be an equivalent polynomial of minimal degree.\n\n    The most important option is hints. Its entries can be any of the\n    following:\n\n    - a natural number\n    - a function\n    - an iterable of the form (func, var1, var2, ...)\n    - anything else, interpreted as a generator\n\n    A number is used to indicate that the search space should be increased.\n    A function is used to indicate that said function is likely to occur in a\n    simplified expression.\n    An iterable is used indicate that func(var1 + var2 + ...) is likely to\n    occur in a simplified .\n    An additional generator also indicates that it is likely to occur.\n    (See examples below).\n\n    This routine carries out various computationally intensive algorithms.\n    The option ``quick=True`` can be used to suppress one particularly slow\n    step (at the expense of potentially more complicated results, but never at\n    the expense of increased total degree).\n\n    Examples\n    ========\n\n    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y\n    >>> from sympy import sin, tan, cos, sinh, cosh, tanh\n    >>> from sympy.simplify.trigsimp import trigsimp_groebner\n\n    Suppose you want to simplify ``sin(x)*cos(x)``. Naively, nothing happens:\n\n    >>> ex = sin(x)*cos(x)\n    >>> trigsimp_groebner(ex)\n    sin(x)*cos(x)\n\n    This is because ``trigsimp_groebner`` only looks for a simplification\n    involving just ``sin(x)`` and ``cos(x)``. You can tell it to also try\n    ``2*x`` by passing ``hints=[2]``:\n\n    >>> trigsimp_groebner(ex, hints=[2])\n    sin(2*x)/2\n    >>> trigsimp_groebner(sin(x)**2 - cos(x)**2, hints=[2])\n    -cos(2*x)\n\n    Increasing the search space this way can quickly become expensive. A much\n    faster way is to give a specific expression that is likely to occur:\n\n    >>> trigsimp_groebner(ex, hints=[sin(2*x)])\n    sin(2*x)/2\n\n    Hyperbolic expressions are similarly supported:\n\n    >>> trigsimp_groebner(sinh(2*x)/sinh(x))\n    2*cosh(x)\n\n    Note how no hints had to be passed, since the expression already involved\n    ``2*x``.\n\n    The tangent function is also supported. You can either pass ``tan`` in the\n    hints, to indicate that tan should be tried whenever cosine or sine are,\n    or you can pass a specific generator:\n\n    >>> trigsimp_groebner(sin(x)/cos(x), hints=[tan])\n    tan(x)\n    >>> trigsimp_groebner(sinh(x)/cosh(x), hints=[tanh(x)])\n    tanh(x)\n\n    Finally, you can use the iterable form to suggest that angle sum formulae\n    should be tried:\n\n    >>> ex = (tan(x) + tan(y))/(1 - tan(x)*tan(y))\n    >>> trigsimp_groebner(ex, hints=[(tan, x, y)])\n    tan(x + y)\n    \"\"\"\n    # TODO\n    #  - preprocess by replacing everything by funcs we can handle\n    # - optionally use cot instead of tan\n    # - more intelligent hinting.\n    #     For example, if the ideal is small, and we have sin(x), sin(y),\n    #     add sin(x + y) automatically... ?\n    # - algebraic numbers ...\n    # - expressions of lowest degree are not distinguished properly\n    #   e.g. 1 - sin(x)**2\n    # - we could try to order the generators intelligently, so as to influence\n    #   which monomials appear in the quotient basis\n\n    # THEORY\n    # ------\n    # Ratsimpmodprime above can be used to \"simplify\" a rational function\n    # modulo a prime ideal. \"Simplify\" mainly means finding an equivalent\n    # expression of lower total degree.\n    #\n    # We intend to use this to simplify trigonometric functions. To do that,\n    # we need to decide (a) which ring to use, and (b) modulo which ideal to\n    # simplify. In practice, (a) means settling on a list of \"generators\"\n    # a, b, c, ..., such that the fraction we want to simplify is a rational\n    # function in a, b, c, ..., with coefficients in ZZ (integers).\n    # (2) means that we have to decide what relations to impose on the\n    # generators. There are two practical problems:\n    #   (1) The ideal has to be *prime* (a technical term).\n    #   (2) The relations have to be polynomials in the generators.\n    #\n    # We typically have two kinds of generators:\n    # - trigonometric expressions, like sin(x), cos(5*x), etc\n    # - \"everything else\", like gamma(x), pi, etc.\n    #\n    # Since this function is trigsimp, we will concentrate on what to do with\n    # trigonometric expressions. We can also simplify hyperbolic expressions,\n    # but the extensions should be clear.\n    #\n    # One crucial point is that all *other* generators really should behave\n    # like indeterminates. In particular if (say) \"I\" is one of them, then\n    # in fact I**2 + 1 = 0 and we may and will compute non-sensical\n    # expressions. However, we can work with a dummy and add the relation\n    # I**2 + 1 = 0 to our ideal, then substitute back in the end.\n    #\n    # Now regarding trigonometric generators. We split them into groups,\n    # according to the argument of the trigonometric functions. We want to\n    # organise this in such a way that most trigonometric identities apply in\n    # the same group. For example, given sin(x), cos(2*x) and cos(y), we would\n    # group as [sin(x), cos(2*x)] and [cos(y)].\n    #\n    # Our prime ideal will be built in three steps:\n    # (1) For each group, compute a \"geometrically prime\" ideal of relations.\n    #     Geometrically prime means that it generates a prime ideal in\n    #     CC[gens], not just ZZ[gens].\n    # (2) Take the union of all the generators of the ideals for all groups.\n    #     By the geometric primality condition, this is still prime.\n    # (3) Add further inter-group relations which preserve primality.\n    #\n    # Step (1) works as follows. We will isolate common factors in the\n    # argument, so that all our generators are of the form sin(n*x), cos(n*x)\n    # or tan(n*x), with n an integer. Suppose first there are no tan terms.\n    # The ideal [sin(x)**2 + cos(x)**2 - 1] is geometrically prime, since\n    # X**2 + Y**2 - 1 is irreducible over CC.\n    # Now, if we have a generator sin(n*x), than we can, using trig identities,\n    # express sin(n*x) as a polynomial in sin(x) and cos(x). We can add this\n    # relation to the ideal, preserving geometric primality, since the quotient\n    # ring is unchanged.\n    # Thus we have treated all sin and cos terms.\n    # For tan(n*x), we add a relation tan(n*x)*cos(n*x) - sin(n*x) = 0.\n    # (This requires of course that we already have relations for cos(n*x) and\n    # sin(n*x).)

This is because the prepare_inputs_from_poa function and prepare_inputs() function handle different input data and verification logic.\nResult: Thus the probability score that this code needs to be modified to solve this issue is 1.\n\nIssue: Enable quiet mode/no-verbose in CLI for use in pre-commit hook\nThere seems to be only an option to increase the level of verbosity when using SQLFluff [CLI], not to limit it further.\r\n\r\nIt would be great to have an option to further limit the amount of prints when running `sqlfluff fix`, especially in combination with deployment using a pre-commit hook. For example, only print the return status and the number of fixes applied, similar to how it is when using `black` in a pre-commit hook:\r\n\r\nThis hides the potentially long list of fixes that are being applied to the SQL files, which can get quite verbose.\nCode:\n```\n# top-level method do_fixed in src/sqlfluff/cli/commands.py file\ndef do_fixes(lnt, result, formatter=None, **kwargs):\n    \"\"\"Actually do the fixes.\"\"\"\n    click.echo(\"Persisting Changes...\")\n    res = result.persist_changes(formatter=formatter, **kwargs)\n    if all(res.values()):\n        click.echo(\"Done.

Please check your files to confirm.\"\n    )  # pragma: no cover\n    click.echo(\n        \"Some errors cannot be fixed or there is another error blocking it.\"\n    )  # pragma: no cover\n    return False  # pragma: no cover\n```\nThought: Users hope to have an option to limit the amount of output information when using the sqlfluff fix command, similar to the output behavior when using black in the pre-commit hook. The purpose is to hide the long list of repairs applied when repairing SQL files, making the output more concise. In the do_fixes function, there are multiple click.echo() calls used to output progress and result messages on the command line. In response to the issue's request, which is to implement a silent mode with less or no output in the CLI, it is necessary to modify this function so that the output can be controlled and the information will only be displayed when necessary. It should be noted that other related functions may need to be modified.\nResult: Thus the probability score that this code needs to be modified to solve this issue is 8.\n\nIssue: Bug within scaling.py wavelet calculation methodology\n**Describe the bug**\r\nMathematical error within the wavelet computation for the scaling.py WVM implementation. Error arises from the methodology, as opposed to just a software bug. \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n```\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nfrom pvlib import scaling\r\ncs = np.random.rand(2**14)\r\nw, ts = scaling._compute_wavelet(cs,1)\r\nprint(np.all( (sum(w)-cs) < 1e-8 ))  # Returns False, expect True\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nFor a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) the sum of all wavelet modes should equate to the original data. \r\n\r\n**Versions:**\r\n - ``pvlib.__version__``: 0.7.2\r\n - ``pandas.__version__``: 1.2.3\r\n - python: 3.8.8\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThis bug is also present in the [PV_LIB](https://pvpmc.sandia.gov/applications/wavelet-variability-model/) Matlab version that was used as the basis for this code (I did reach out to them using the PVLIB MATLAB email form, but don't know who actually wrote that code). Essentially, the existing code throws away the highest level of Detail Coefficient in the transform and keeps an extra level of Approximation coefficient. The impact on the calculation is small, but leads to an incorrect DWT and reconstruction. I have a fix that makes the code pass the theoretical test about the DWT proposed under 'To Reproduce' but there may be some question as to whether this should be corrected or left alone to match the MATLAB code it was based on.\nCode:\n```\n# top-level method _compute_wavelet in pvlib/scaling.py file\ndef _compute_wavelet(clearsky_index, dt=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute the wavelet transform on the input clear_sky time series.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    clearsky_index : numeric or pandas.Series\n        Clear Sky Index time series that will be smoothed.\n\n    dt : float, default None\n        The time series time delta.

Theoretically, for discrete wavelet transform (DWT), the sum of all wavelet modes should be equal to the original data. However, during testing it was found that this reconstruction condition was not met. To resolve this issue, a fundamental change in the implementation of the _compute_wavelet function is required.\nResult: Thus the probability score that this code needs to be modified to solve this issue is 10.\n\n# Now the issue is:\n<issue>sympy.polys.factortools.dmp_zz_mignotte_bound improvement\nThe method `dup_zz_mignotte_bound(f, K)` can be significantly improved by using the **Knuth-Cohen bound** instead. After our research with Prof. Ag.Akritas we have implemented the Knuth-Cohen bound among others, and compare them among dozens of polynomials with different degree, density and coefficients range. Considering the results and the feedback from Mr.Kalevi Suominen, our proposal is that the mignotte_bound should be replaced by the knuth-cohen bound.\nAlso, `dmp_zz_mignotte_bound(f, u, K)` for mutli-variants polynomials should be replaced appropriately.\n</issue>\nCode:\n```\n# top-level function method subresultants_vv in sympy/polys/subresultants_qq_zz.py file\ndef subresultants_vv(p, q, x, method = 0):\n    \"\"\"\n    p, q are polynomials in Z[x] (intended) or Q[x].

Required column names\n        include ``'poa_global'``, ``'poa_direct'`` and ``'poa_diffuse'``.\n        Columns with weather-related data are ssigned to the\n        ``weather`` attribute.  If columns for ``'temp_air'`` and\n        ``'wind_speed'`` are not provided, air temperature of 20 C and wind\n        speed of 0 m/s are assumed.\n\n    Notes\n    -----\n    Assigns attributes: ``weather``, ``total_irrad``, ``solar_position``,\n    ``airmass``, ``aoi``.\n\n    See also\n    --------\n    pvlib.modelchain.ModelChain.prepare_inputs\n    \"\"\"\n\n    self._assign_weather(data)\n\n    self._verify_df(data, required=['poa_global', 'poa_direct',\n                                        'poa_diffuse'])\n    self._assign_total_irrad(data)\n\n    self._prep_inputs_solar_pos()\n    self._prep_inputs_airmass()\n\n    if isinstance(self.system, SingleAxisTracker):\n        self._prep_inputs_tracking()\n    else:\n        self._prep_inputs_fixed()\n\n    return self\n```\nThought: To solve the verification problem in the ModelChain.prepare_inputs() method mentioned in the issue, we do not need to modify the prepare_inputs_from_poa function, but should focus on ModelChain.prepare_inputs() itself. This is because the prepare_inputs_from_poa function and prepare_inputs() function handle different input data and verification logic.\nResult: Thus the probability score that this code needs to be modified to solve this issue is 1.\n\nIssue: Enable quiet mode/no-verbose in CLI for use in pre-commit hook\nThere seems to be only an option to increase the level of verbosity when using SQLFluff [CLI], not to limit it further.\r\n\r\nIt would be great to have an option to further limit the amount of prints when running `sqlfluff fix`, especially in combination with deployment using a pre-commit hook. For example, only print the return status and the number of fixes applied, similar to how it is when using `black` in a pre-commit hook:\r\n\r\nThis hides the potentially long list of fixes that are being applied to the SQL files, which can get quite verbose.\nCode:\n```\n# top-level method do_fixed in src/sqlfluff/cli/commands.py file\ndef do_fixes(lnt, result, formatter=None, **kwargs):\n    \"\"\"Actually do the fixes.\"\"\"\n    click.echo(\"Persisting Changes...\")\n    res = result.persist_changes(formatter=formatter, **kwargs)\n    if all(res.values()):\n        click.echo(\"Done. Please check your files to confirm.\")\n        return True\n    # If some failed then return false\n    click.echo(\n        \"Done. Some operations failed. Please check your files to confirm.\"\n    )  # pragma: no cover\n    click.echo(\n        \"Some errors cannot be fixed or there is another error blocking it.\"\n    )  # pragma: no cover\n    return False  # pragma: no cover\n```\nThought: Users hope to have an option to limit the amount of output information when using the sqlfluff fix command, similar to the output behavior when using black in the pre-commit hook. The purpose is to hide the long list of repairs applied when repairing SQL files, making the output more concise. In the do_fixes function, there are multiple click.echo() calls used to output progress and result messages on the command line. In response to the issue's request, which is to implement a silent mode with less or no output in the CLI, it is necessary to modify this function so that the output can be controlled and the information will only be displayed when necessary. It should be noted that other related functions may need to be modified.\nResult: Thus the probability score that this code needs to be modified to solve this issue is 8.\n\nIssue: Bug within scaling.py wavelet calculation methodology\n**Describe the bug**\r\nMathematical error within the wavelet computation for the scaling.py WVM implementation. Error arises from the methodology, as opposed to just a software bug. \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n```\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nfrom pvlib import scaling\r\ncs = np.random.rand(2**14)\r\nw, ts = scaling._compute_wavelet(cs,1)\r\nprint(np.all( (sum(w)-cs) < 1e-8 ))  # Returns False, expect True\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nFor a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) the sum of all wavelet modes should equate to the original data. \r\n\r\n**Versions:**\r\n - ``pvlib.__version__``: 0.7.2\r\n - ``pandas.__version__``: 1.2.3\r\n - python: 3.8.8\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThis bug is also present in the [PV_LIB](https://pvpmc.sandia.gov/applications/wavelet-variability-model/) Matlab version that was used as the basis for this code (I did reach out to them using the PVLIB MATLAB email form, but don't know who actually wrote that code). Essentially, the existing code throws away the highest level of Detail Coefficient in the transform and keeps an extra level of Approximation coefficient. The impact on the calculation is small, but leads to an incorrect DWT and reconstruction. I have a fix that makes the code pass the theoretical test about the DWT proposed under 'To Reproduce' but there may be some question as to whether this should be corrected or left alone to match the MATLAB code it was based on.\nCode:\n```\n# top-level method _compute_wavelet in pvlib/scaling.py file\ndef _compute_wavelet(clearsky_index, dt=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute the wavelet transform on the input clear_sky time series.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    clearsky_index : numeric or pandas.Series\n        Clear Sky Index time series that will be smoothed.\n\n    dt : float, default None\n        The time series time delta.

Theoretically, for discrete wavelet transform (DWT), the sum of all wavelet modes should be equal to the original data. However, during testing it was found that this reconstruction condition was not met. To resolve this issue, a fundamental change in the implementation of the _compute_wavelet function is required.\nResult: Thus the probability score that this code needs to be modified to solve this issue is 10.\n\n# Now the issue is:\n<issue>sympy.polys.factortools.dmp_zz_mignotte_bound improvement\nThe method `dup_zz_mignotte_bound(f, K)` can be significantly improved by using the **Knuth-Cohen bound** instead. After our research with Prof. Ag.Akritas we have implemented the Knuth-Cohen bound among others, and compare them among dozens of polynomials with different degree, density and coefficients range. Considering the results and the feedback from Mr.Kalevi Suominen, our proposal is that the mignotte_bound should be replaced by the knuth-cohen bound.\nAlso, `dmp_zz_mignotte_bound(f, u, K)` for mutli-variants polynomials should be replaced appropriately.\n</issue>\nCode:\n```\n# top-level function method _undetermined_coefficients_match in sympy/solvers/ode/ode.py file\ndef _undetermined_coefficients_match(expr, x, func=None, eq_homogeneous=S.Zero):\n    r\"\"\"\n    Returns a trial function match if undetermined coefficients can be applied\n    to ``expr``, and ``None`` otherwise.\n\n    A trial expression can be found for an expression for use with the method\n    of undetermined coefficients if the expression is an\n    additive/multiplicative combination of constants, polynomials in `x` (the\n    independent variable of expr), `\\sin(a x + b)`, `\\cos(a x + b)`, and\n    `e^{a x}` terms (in other words, it has a finite number of linearly\n    independent derivatives).\n\n    Note that you may still need to multiply each term returned here by\n    sufficient `x` to make it linearly independent with the solutions to the\n    homogeneous equation.\n\n    This is intended for internal use by ``undetermined_coefficients`` hints.\n\n    SymPy currently has no way to convert `\\sin^n(x) \\cos^m(y)` into a sum of\n    only `\\sin(a x)` and `\\cos(b x)` terms, so these are not implemented.

If columns for ``'temp_air'`` and\n        ``'wind_speed'`` are not provided, air temperature of 20 C and wind\n        speed of 0 m/s are assumed.\n\n    Notes\n    -----\n    Assigns attributes: ``weather``, ``total_irrad``, ``solar_position``,\n    ``airmass``, ``aoi``.\n\n    See also\n    --------\n    pvlib.modelchain.ModelChain.prepare_inputs\n    \"\"\"\n\n    self._assign_weather(data)\n\n    self._verify_df(data, required=['poa_global', 'poa_direct',\n                                        'poa_diffuse'])\n    self._assign_total_irrad(data)\n\n    self._prep_inputs_solar_pos()\n    self._prep_inputs_airmass()\n\n    if isinstance(self.system, SingleAxisTracker):\n        self._prep_inputs_tracking()\n    else:\n        self._prep_inputs_fixed()\n\n    return self\n```\nThought: To solve the verification problem in the ModelChain.prepare_inputs() method mentioned in the issue, we do not need to modify the prepare_inputs_from_poa function, but should focus on ModelChain.prepare_inputs() itself. This is because the prepare_inputs_from_poa function and prepare_inputs() function handle different input data and verification logic.\nResult: Thus the probability score that this code needs to be modified to solve this issue is 1.\n\nIssue: Enable quiet mode/no-verbose in CLI for use in pre-commit hook\nThere seems to be only an option to increase the level of verbosity when using SQLFluff [CLI], not to limit it further.\r\n\r\nIt would be great to have an option to further limit the amount of prints when running `sqlfluff fix`, especially in combination with deployment using a pre-commit hook. For example, only print the return status and the number of fixes applied, similar to how it is when using `black` in a pre-commit hook:\r\n\r\nThis hides the potentially long list of fixes that are being applied to the SQL files, which can get quite verbose.\nCode:\n```\n# top-level method do_fixed in src/sqlfluff/cli/commands.py file\ndef do_fixes(lnt, result, formatter=None, **kwargs):\n    \"\"\"Actually do the fixes.\"\"\"\n    click.echo(\"Persisting Changes...\")\n    res = result.persist_changes(formatter=formatter, **kwargs)\n    if all(res.values()):\n        click.echo(\"Done. Please check your files to confirm.\")\n        return True\n    # If some failed then return false\n    click.echo(\n        \"Done. Some operations failed. Please check your files to confirm.\"\n    )  # pragma: no cover\n    click.echo(\n        \"Some errors cannot be fixed or there is another error blocking it.\"\n    )  # pragma: no cover\n    return False  # pragma: no cover\n```\nThought: Users hope to have an option to limit the amount of output information when using the sqlfluff fix command, similar to the output behavior when using black in the pre-commit hook. The purpose is to hide the long list of repairs applied when repairing SQL files, making the output more concise. In the do_fixes function, there are multiple click.echo() calls used to output progress and result messages on the command line. In response to the issue's request, which is to implement a silent mode with less or no output in the CLI, it is necessary to modify this function so that the output can be controlled and the information will only be displayed when necessary. It should be noted that other related functions may need to be modified.\nResult: Thus the probability score that this code needs to be modified to solve this issue is 8.\n\nIssue: Bug within scaling.py wavelet calculation methodology\n**Describe the bug**\r\nMathematical error within the wavelet computation for the scaling.py WVM implementation. Error arises from the methodology, as opposed to just a software bug. \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n```\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nfrom pvlib import scaling\r\ncs = np.random.rand(2**14)\r\nw, ts = scaling._compute_wavelet(cs,1)\r\nprint(np.all( (sum(w)-cs) < 1e-8 ))  # Returns False, expect True\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nFor a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) the sum of all wavelet modes should equate to the original data. \r\n\r\n**Versions:**\r\n - ``pvlib.__version__``: 0.7.2\r\n - ``pandas.__version__``: 1.2.3\r\n - python: 3.8.8\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThis bug is also present in the [PV_LIB](https://pvpmc.sandia.gov/applications/wavelet-variability-model/) Matlab version that was used as the basis for this code (I did reach out to them using the PVLIB MATLAB email form, but don't know who actually wrote that code). Essentially, the existing code throws away the highest level of Detail Coefficient in the transform and keeps an extra level of Approximation coefficient. The impact on the calculation is small, but leads to an incorrect DWT and reconstruction. I have a fix that makes the code pass the theoretical test about the DWT proposed under 'To Reproduce' but there may be some question as to whether this should be corrected or left alone to match the MATLAB code it was based on.\nCode:\n```\n# top-level method _compute_wavelet in pvlib/scaling.py file\ndef _compute_wavelet(clearsky_index, dt=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute the wavelet transform on the input clear_sky time series.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    clearsky_index : numeric or pandas.Series\n        Clear Sky Index time series that will be smoothed.\n\n    dt : float, default None\n        The time series time delta.

Theoretically, for discrete wavelet transform (DWT), the sum of all wavelet modes should be equal to the original data. However, during testing it was found that this reconstruction condition was not met. To resolve this issue, a fundamental change in the implementation of the _compute_wavelet function is required.\nResult: Thus the probability score that this code needs to be modified to solve this issue is 10.\n\n# Now the issue is:\n<issue>sympy.polys.factortools.dmp_zz_mignotte_bound improvement\nThe method `dup_zz_mignotte_bound(f, K)` can be significantly improved by using the **Knuth-Cohen bound** instead. After our research with Prof. Ag.Akritas we have implemented the Knuth-Cohen bound among others, and compare them among dozens of polynomials with different degree, density and coefficients range. Considering the results and the feedback from Mr.Kalevi Suominen, our proposal is that the mignotte_bound should be replaced by the knuth-cohen bound.\nAlso, `dmp_zz_mignotte_bound(f, u, K)` for mutli-variants polynomials should be replaced appropriately.\n</issue>\nCode:\n```\n# top-level function method get_contraction_structure in sympy/tensor/index_methods.py file\ndef get_contraction_structure(expr):\n    \"\"\"Determine dummy indices of ``expr`` and describe its structure\n\n    By *dummy* we mean indices that are summation indices.\n\n    The structure of the expression is determined and described as follows:\n\n    1) A conforming summation of Indexed objects is described with a dict where\n       the keys are summation indices and the corresponding values are sets\n       containing all terms for which the summation applies.

A nested dict displays nested\n       contractions and may itself contain dicts from a deeper level.

This is because the prepare_inputs_from_poa function and prepare_inputs() function handle different input data and verification logic.\nResult: Thus the probability score that this code needs to be modified to solve this issue is 1.\n\nIssue: Enable quiet mode/no-verbose in CLI for use in pre-commit hook\nThere seems to be only an option to increase the level of verbosity when using SQLFluff [CLI], not to limit it further.\r\n\r\nIt would be great to have an option to further limit the amount of prints when running `sqlfluff fix`, especially in combination with deployment using a pre-commit hook. For example, only print the return status and the number of fixes applied, similar to how it is when using `black` in a pre-commit hook:\r\n\r\nThis hides the potentially long list of fixes that are being applied to the SQL files, which can get quite verbose.\nCode:\n```\n# top-level method do_fixed in src/sqlfluff/cli/commands.py file\ndef do_fixes(lnt, result, formatter=None, **kwargs):\n    \"\"\"Actually do the fixes.\"\"\"\n    click.echo(\"Persisting Changes...\")\n    res = result.persist_changes(formatter=formatter, **kwargs)\n    if all(res.values()):\n        click.echo(\"Done. Please check your files to confirm.\")\n        return True\n    # If some failed then return false\n    click.echo(\n        \"Done. Some operations failed. Please check your files to confirm.\"\n    )  # pragma: no cover\n    click.echo(\n        \"Some errors cannot be fixed or there is another error blocking it.\"\n    )  # pragma: no cover\n    return False  # pragma: no cover\n```\nThought: Users hope to have an option to limit the amount of output information when using the sqlfluff fix command, similar to the output behavior when using black in the pre-commit hook. The purpose is to hide the long list of repairs applied when repairing SQL files, making the output more concise. In the do_fixes function, there are multiple click.echo() calls used to output progress and result messages on the command line. In response to the issue's request, which is to implement a silent mode with less or no output in the CLI, it is necessary to modify this function so that the output can be controlled and the information will only be displayed when necessary. It should be noted that other related functions may need to be modified.\nResult: Thus the probability score that this code needs to be modified to solve this issue is 8.\n\nIssue: Bug within scaling.py wavelet calculation methodology\n**Describe the bug**\r\nMathematical error within the wavelet computation for the scaling.py WVM implementation. Error arises from the methodology, as opposed to just a software bug. \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n```\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nfrom pvlib import scaling\r\ncs = np.random.rand(2**14)\r\nw, ts = scaling._compute_wavelet(cs,1)\r\nprint(np.all( (sum(w)-cs) < 1e-8 ))  # Returns False, expect True\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nFor a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) the sum of all wavelet modes should equate to the original data. \r\n\r\n**Versions:**\r\n - ``pvlib.__version__``: 0.7.2\r\n - ``pandas.__version__``: 1.2.3\r\n - python: 3.8.8\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThis bug is also present in the [PV_LIB](https://pvpmc.sandia.gov/applications/wavelet-variability-model/) Matlab version that was used as the basis for this code (I did reach out to them using the PVLIB MATLAB email form, but don't know who actually wrote that code). Essentially, the existing code throws away the highest level of Detail Coefficient in the transform and keeps an extra level of Approximation coefficient. The impact on the calculation is small, but leads to an incorrect DWT and reconstruction. I have a fix that makes the code pass the theoretical test about the DWT proposed under 'To Reproduce' but there may be some question as to whether this should be corrected or left alone to match the MATLAB code it was based on.\nCode:\n```\n# top-level method _compute_wavelet in pvlib/scaling.py file\ndef _compute_wavelet(clearsky_index, dt=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute the wavelet transform on the input clear_sky time series.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    clearsky_index : numeric or pandas.Series\n        Clear Sky Index time series that will be smoothed.\n\n    dt : float, default None\n        The time series time delta.

Theoretically, for discrete wavelet transform (DWT), the sum of all wavelet modes should be equal to the original data.

If columns for ``'temp_air'`` and\n        ``'wind_speed'`` are not provided, air temperature of 20 C and wind\n        speed of 0 m/s are assumed.\n\n    Notes\n    -----\n    Assigns attributes: ``weather``, ``total_irrad``, ``solar_position``,\n    ``airmass``, ``aoi``.\n\n    See also\n    --------\n    pvlib.modelchain.ModelChain.prepare_inputs\n    \"\"\"\n\n    self._assign_weather(data)\n\n    self._verify_df(data, required=['poa_global', 'poa_direct',\n                                        'poa_diffuse'])\n    self._assign_total_irrad(data)\n\n    self._prep_inputs_solar_pos()\n    self._prep_inputs_airmass()\n\n    if isinstance(self.system, SingleAxisTracker):\n        self._prep_inputs_tracking()\n    else:\n        self._prep_inputs_fixed()\n\n    return self\n```\nThought: To solve the verification problem in the ModelChain.prepare_inputs() method mentioned in the issue, we do not need to modify the prepare_inputs_from_poa function, but should focus on ModelChain.prepare_inputs() itself. This is because the prepare_inputs_from_poa function and prepare_inputs() function handle different input data and verification logic.\nResult: Thus the probability score that this code needs to be modified to solve this issue is 1.\n\nIssue: Enable quiet mode/no-verbose in CLI for use in pre-commit hook\nThere seems to be only an option to increase the level of verbosity when using SQLFluff [CLI], not to limit it further.\r\n\r\nIt would be great to have an option to further limit the amount of prints when running `sqlfluff fix`, especially in combination with deployment using a pre-commit hook. For example, only print the return status and the number of fixes applied, similar to how it is when using `black` in a pre-commit hook:\r\n\r\nThis hides the potentially long list of fixes that are being applied to the SQL files, which can get quite verbose.\nCode:\n```\n# top-level method do_fixed in src/sqlfluff/cli/commands.py file\ndef do_fixes(lnt, result, formatter=None, **kwargs):\n    \"\"\"Actually do the fixes.\"\"\"\n    click.echo(\"Persisting Changes...\")\n    res = result.persist_changes(formatter=formatter, **kwargs)\n    if all(res.values()):\n        click.echo(\"Done. Please check your files to confirm.\")\n        return True\n    # If some failed then return false\n    click.echo(\n        \"Done. Some operations failed. Please check your files to confirm.\"\n    )  # pragma: no cover\n    click.echo(\n        \"Some errors cannot be fixed or there is another error blocking it.\"\n    )  # pragma: no cover\n    return False  # pragma: no cover\n```\nThought: Users hope to have an option to limit the amount of output information when using the sqlfluff fix command, similar to the output behavior when using black in the pre-commit hook. The purpose is to hide the long list of repairs applied when repairing SQL files, making the output more concise. In the do_fixes function, there are multiple click.echo() calls used to output progress and result messages on the command line. In response to the issue's request, which is to implement a silent mode with less or no output in the CLI, it is necessary to modify this function so that the output can be controlled and the information will only be displayed when necessary. It should be noted that other related functions may need to be modified.\nResult: Thus the probability score that this code needs to be modified to solve this issue is 8.\n\nIssue: Bug within scaling.py wavelet calculation methodology\n**Describe the bug**\r\nMathematical error within the wavelet computation for the scaling.py WVM implementation. Error arises from the methodology, as opposed to just a software bug. \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n```\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nfrom pvlib import scaling\r\ncs = np.random.rand(2**14)\r\nw, ts = scaling._compute_wavelet(cs,1)\r\nprint(np.all( (sum(w)-cs) < 1e-8 ))  # Returns False, expect True\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nFor a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) the sum of all wavelet modes should equate to the original data. \r\n\r\n**Versions:**\r\n - ``pvlib.__version__``: 0.7.2\r\n - ``pandas.__version__``: 1.2.3\r\n - python: 3.8.8\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThis bug is also present in the [PV_LIB](https://pvpmc.sandia.gov/applications/wavelet-variability-model/) Matlab version that was used as the basis for this code (I did reach out to them using the PVLIB MATLAB email form, but don't know who actually wrote that code). Essentially, the existing code throws away the highest level of Detail Coefficient in the transform and keeps an extra level of Approximation coefficient. The impact on the calculation is small, but leads to an incorrect DWT and reconstruction. I have a fix that makes the code pass the theoretical test about the DWT proposed under 'To Reproduce' but there may be some question as to whether this should be corrected or left alone to match the MATLAB code it was based on.\nCode:\n```\n# top-level method _compute_wavelet in pvlib/scaling.py file\ndef _compute_wavelet(clearsky_index, dt=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute the wavelet transform on the input clear_sky time series.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    clearsky_index : numeric or pandas.Series\n        Clear Sky Index time series that will be smoothed.\n\n    dt : float, default None\n        The time series time delta.

Theoretically, for discrete wavelet transform (DWT), the sum of all wavelet modes should be equal to the original data. However, during testing it was found that this reconstruction condition was not met. To resolve this issue, a fundamental change in the implementation of the _compute_wavelet function is required.\nResult: Thus the probability score that this code needs to be modified to solve this issue is 10.\n\n# Now the issue is:\n<issue>sympy.polys.factortools.dmp_zz_mignotte_bound improvement\nThe method `dup_zz_mignotte_bound(f, K)` can be significantly improved by using the **Knuth-Cohen bound** instead. After our research with Prof. Ag.Akritas we have implemented the Knuth-Cohen bound among others, and compare them among dozens of polynomials with different degree, density and coefficients range. Considering the results and the feedback from Mr.Kalevi Suominen, our proposal is that the mignotte_bound should be replaced by the knuth-cohen bound.\nAlso, `dmp_zz_mignotte_bound(f, u, K)` for mutli-variants polynomials should be replaced appropriately.\n</issue>\nCode:\n```\n# top-level function method trigsimp_groebner in sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py file\ndef trigsimp_groebner(expr, hints=[], quick=False, order=\"grlex\",\n                      polynomial=False):\n    \"\"\"\n    Simplify trigonometric expressions using a groebner basis algorithm.\n\n    This routine takes a fraction involving trigonometric or hyperbolic\n    expressions, and tries to simplify it. The primary metric is the\n    total degree. Some attempts are made to choose the simplest possible\n    expression of the minimal degree, but this is non-rigorous, and also\n    very slow (see the ``quick=True`` option).\n\n    If ``polynomial`` is set to True, instead of simplifying numerator and\n    denominator together, this function just brings numerator and denominator\n    into a canonical form. This is much faster, but has potentially worse\n    results. However, if the input is a polynomial, then the result is\n    guaranteed to be an equivalent polynomial of minimal degree.\n\n    The most important option is hints. Its entries can be any of the\n    following:\n\n    - a natural number\n    - a function\n    - an iterable of the form (func, var1, var2, ...)\n    - anything else, interpreted as a generator\n\n    A number is used to indicate that the search space should be increased.\n    A function is used to indicate that said function is likely to occur in a\n    simplified expression.\n    An iterable is used indicate that func(var1 + var2 + ...) is likely to\n    occur in a simplified .\n    An additional generator also indicates that it is likely to occur.\n    (See examples below).\n\n    This routine carries out various computationally intensive algorithms.\n    The option ``quick=True`` can be used to suppress one particularly slow\n    step (at the expense of potentially more complicated results, but never at\n    the expense of increased total degree).\n\n    Examples\n    ========\n\n    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y\n    >>> from sympy import sin, tan, cos, sinh, cosh, tanh\n    >>> from sympy.simplify.trigsimp import trigsimp_groebner\n\n    Suppose you want to simplify ``sin(x)*cos(x)``. Naively, nothing happens:\n\n    >>> ex = sin(x)*cos(x)\n    >>> trigsimp_groebner(ex)\n    sin(x)*cos(x)\n\n    This is because ``trigsimp_groebner`` only looks for a simplification\n    involving just ``sin(x)`` and ``cos(x)``. You can tell it to also try\n    ``2*x`` by passing ``hints=[2]``:\n\n    >>> trigsimp_groebner(ex, hints=[2])\n    sin(2*x)/2\n    >>> trigsimp_groebner(sin(x)**2 - cos(x)**2, hints=[2])\n    -cos(2*x)\n\n    Increasing the search space this way can quickly become expensive. A much\n    faster way is to give a specific expression that is likely to occur:\n\n    >>> trigsimp_groebner(ex, hints=[sin(2*x)])\n    sin(2*x)/2\n\n    Hyperbolic expressions are similarly supported:\n\n    >>> trigsimp_groebner(sinh(2*x)/sinh(x))\n    2*cosh(x)\n\n    Note how no hints had to be passed, since the expression already involved\n    ``2*x``.\n\n    The tangent function is also supported. You can either pass ``tan`` in the\n    hints, to indicate that tan should be tried whenever cosine or sine are,\n    or you can pass a specific generator:\n\n    >>> trigsimp_groebner(sin(x)/cos(x), hints=[tan])\n    tan(x)\n    >>> trigsimp_groebner(sinh(x)/cosh(x), hints=[tanh(x)])\n    tanh(x)\n\n    Finally, you can use the iterable form to suggest that angle sum formulae\n    should be tried:\n\n    >>> ex = (tan(x) + tan(y))/(1 - tan(x)*tan(y))\n    >>> trigsimp_groebner(ex, hints=[(tan, x, y)])\n    tan(x + y)\n    \"\"\"\n    # TODO\n    #  - preprocess by replacing everything by funcs we can handle\n    # - optionally use cot instead of tan\n    # - more intelligent hinting.\n    #     For example, if the ideal is small, and we have sin(x), sin(y),\n    #     add sin(x + y) automatically... ?\n    # - algebraic numbers ...\n    # - expressions of lowest degree are not distinguished properly\n    #   e.g. 1 - sin(x)**2\n    # - we could try to order the generators intelligently, so as to influence\n    #   which monomials appear in the quotient basis\n\n    # THEORY\n    # ------\n    # Ratsimpmodprime above can be used to \"simplify\" a rational function\n    # modulo a prime ideal. \"Simplify\" mainly means finding an equivalent\n    # expression of lower total degree.\n    #\n    # We intend to use this to simplify trigonometric functions. To do that,\n    # we need to decide (a) which ring to use, and (b) modulo which ideal to\n    # simplify. In practice, (a) means settling on a list of \"generators\"\n    # a, b, c, ..., such that the fraction we want to simplify is a rational\n    # function in a, b, c, ..., with coefficients in ZZ (integers).\n    # (2) means that we have to decide what relations to impose on the\n    # generators. There are two practical problems:\n    #   (1) The ideal has to be *prime* (a technical term).\n    #   (2) The relations have to be polynomials in the generators.\n    #\n    # We typically have two kinds of generators:\n    # - trigonometric expressions, like sin(x), cos(5*x), etc\n    # - \"everything else\", like gamma(x), pi, etc.\n    #\n    # Since this function is trigsimp, we will concentrate on what to do with\n    # trigonometric expressions. We can also simplify hyperbolic expressions,\n    # but the extensions should be clear.\n    #\n    # One crucial point is that all *other* generators really should behave\n    # like indeterminates. In particular if (say) \"I\" is one of them, then\n    # in fact I**2 + 1 = 0 and we may and will compute non-sensical\n    # expressions. However, we can work with a dummy and add the relation\n    # I**2 + 1 = 0 to our ideal, then substitute back in the end.\n    #\n    # Now regarding trigonometric generators. We split them into groups,\n    # according to the argument of the trigonometric functions. We want to\n    # organise this in such a way that most trigonometric identities apply in\n    # the same group. For example, given sin(x), cos(2*x) and cos(y), we would\n    # group as [sin(x), cos(2*x)] and [cos(y)].\n    #\n    # Our prime ideal will be built in three steps:\n    # (1) For each group, compute a \"geometrically prime\" ideal of relations.\n    #     Geometrically prime means that it generates a prime ideal in\n    #     CC[gens], not just ZZ[gens].\n    # (2) Take the union of all the generators of the ideals for all groups.\n    #     By the geometric primality condition, this is still prime.\n    # (3) Add further inter-group relations which preserve primality.\n    #\n    # Step (1) works as follows. We will isolate common factors in the\n    # argument, so that all our generators are of the form sin(n*x), cos(n*x)\n    # or tan(n*x), with n an integer. Suppose first there are no tan terms.\n    # The ideal [sin(x)**2 + cos(x)**2 - 1] is geometrically prime, since\n    # X**2 + Y**2 - 1 is irreducible over CC.\n    # Now, if we have a generator sin(n*x), than we can, using trig identities,\n    # express sin(n*x) as a polynomial in sin(x) and cos(x). We can add this\n    # relation to the ideal, preserving geometric primality, since the quotient\n    # ring is unchanged.\n    # Thus we have treated all sin and cos terms.\n    # For tan(n*x), we add a relation tan(n*x)*cos(n*x) - sin(n*x) = 0.\n    # (This requires of course that we already have relations for cos(n*x) and\n    # sin(n*x).) It is not obvious, but it seems that this preserves geometric\n    # primality.\n    # XXX A real proof would be nice.

The purpose is to hide the long list of repairs applied when repairing SQL files, making the output more concise. In the do_fixes function, there are multiple click.echo() calls used to output progress and result messages on the command line. In response to the issue's request, which is to implement a silent mode with less or no output in the CLI, it is necessary to modify this function so that the output can be controlled and the information will only be displayed when necessary.

Essentially, the existing code throws away the highest level of Detail Coefficient in the transform and keeps an extra level of Approximation coefficient. The impact on the calculation is small, but leads to an incorrect DWT and reconstruction. I have a fix that makes the code pass the theoretical test about the DWT proposed under 'To Reproduce' but there may be some question as to whether this should be corrected or left alone to match the MATLAB code it was based on.\nCode:\n```\n# top-level method _compute_wavelet in pvlib/scaling.py file\ndef _compute_wavelet(clearsky_index, dt=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute the wavelet transform on the input clear_sky time series.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    clearsky_index : numeric or pandas.Series\n        Clear Sky Index time series that will be smoothed.\n\n    dt : float, default None\n        The time series time delta.

Theoretically, for discrete wavelet transform (DWT), the sum of all wavelet modes should be equal to the original data. However, during testing it was found that this reconstruction condition was not met. To resolve this issue, a fundamental change in the implementation of the _compute_wavelet function is required.\nResult: Thus the probability score that this code needs to be modified to solve this issue is 10.\n\n# Now the issue is:\n<issue>sympy.polys.factortools.dmp_zz_mignotte_bound improvement\nThe method `dup_zz_mignotte_bound(f, K)` can be significantly improved by using the **Knuth-Cohen bound** instead. After our research with Prof. Ag.Akritas we have implemented the Knuth-Cohen bound among others, and compare them among dozens of polynomials with different degree, density and coefficients range. Considering the results and the feedback from Mr.Kalevi Suominen, our proposal is that the mignotte_bound should be replaced by the knuth-cohen bound.\nAlso, `dmp_zz_mignotte_bound(f, u, K)` for mutli-variants polynomials should be replaced appropriately.\n</issue>\nCode:\n```\n# top-level function method _undetermined_coefficients_match in sympy/solvers/ode/ode.py file\ndef _undetermined_coefficients_match(expr, x, func=None, eq_homogeneous=S.Zero):\n    r\"\"\"\n    Returns a trial function match if undetermined coefficients can be applied\n    to ``expr``, and ``None`` otherwise.\n\n    A trial expression can be found for an expression for use with the method\n    of undetermined coefficients if the expression is an\n    additive/multiplicative combination of constants, polynomials in `x` (the\n    independent variable of expr), `\\sin(a x + b)`, `\\cos(a x + b)`, and\n    `e^{a x}` terms (in other words, it has a finite number of linearly\n    independent derivatives).\n\n    Note that you may still need to multiply each term returned here by\n    sufficient `x` to make it linearly independent with the solutions to the\n    homogeneous equation.\n\n    This is intended for internal use by ``undetermined_coefficients`` hints.\n\n    SymPy currently has no way to convert `\\sin^n(x) \\cos^m(y)` into a sum of\n    only `\\sin(a x)` and `\\cos(b x)` terms, so these are not implemented.

Theoretically, for discrete wavelet transform (DWT), the sum of all wavelet modes should be equal to the original data. However, during testing it was found that this reconstruction condition was not met. To resolve this issue, a fundamental change in the implementation of the _compute_wavelet function is required.\nResult: Thus the probability score that this code needs to be modified to solve this issue is 10.\n\n# Now the issue is:\n<issue>collect_factor_and_dimension does not detect equivalent dimensions in addition\nCode to reproduce:\n```python\nfrom sympy.physics import units\nfrom sympy.physics.units.systems.si import SI\nv1 = units.Quantity('v1')\nSI.set_quantity_dimension(v1, units.velocity)\nSI.set_quantity_scale_factor(v1, 2 * units.meter / units.second)\na1 = units.Quantity('a1')\nSI.set_quantity_dimension(a1, units.acceleration)\nSI.set_quantity_scale_factor(a1, -9.8 * units.meter / units.second**2)\nt1 = units.Quantity('t1')\nSI.set_quantity_dimension(t1, units.time)\nSI.set_quantity_scale_factor(t1, 5 * units.second)\nexpr1 = a1*t1 + v1\nSI._collect_factor_and_dimension(expr1)\n```\nResults in:\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nFile \"C:\\Python\\Python310\\lib\\site-packages\\sympy\\physics\\units\\unitsystem.py\", line 179, in _collect_factor_and_dimension\nraise ValueError(\nValueError: Dimension of \"v1\" is Dimension(velocity), but it should be Dimension(acceleration*time)\n```\n</issue>\nCode:\n```\n# top-level function method wigner_d in sympy/physics/wigner.py file\ndef wigner_d(J, alpha, beta, gamma):\n    \"\"\"Return the Wigner D matrix for angular momentum J.\n\n    Explanation\n    ===========\n\n    J :\n        An integer, half-integer, or SymPy symbol for the total angular\n        momentum of the angular momentum space being rotated.\n    alpha, beta, gamma - Real numbers representing the Euler.\n        Angles of rotation about the so-called vertical, line of nodes, and\n        figure axes.

This is because the prepare_inputs_from_poa function and prepare_inputs() function handle different input data and verification logic.\nResult: Thus the probability score that this code needs to be modified to solve this issue is 1.\n\nIssue: Enable quiet mode/no-verbose in CLI for use in pre-commit hook\nThere seems to be only an option to increase the level of verbosity when using SQLFluff [CLI], not to limit it further.\r\n\r\nIt would be great to have an option to further limit the amount of prints when running `sqlfluff fix`, especially in combination with deployment using a pre-commit hook. For example, only print the return status and the number of fixes applied, similar to how it is when using `black` in a pre-commit hook:\r\n\r\nThis hides the potentially long list of fixes that are being applied to the SQL files, which can get quite verbose.\nCode:\n```\n# top-level method do_fixed in src/sqlfluff/cli/commands.py file\ndef do_fixes(lnt, result, formatter=None, **kwargs):\n    \"\"\"Actually do the fixes.\"\"\"\n    click.echo(\"Persisting Changes...\")\n    res = result.persist_changes(formatter=formatter, **kwargs)\n    if all(res.values()):\n        click.echo(\"Done. Please check your files to confirm.\")\n        return True\n    # If some failed then return false\n    click.echo(\n        \"Done. Some operations failed. Please check your files to confirm.\"\n    )  # pragma: no cover\n    click.echo(\n        \"Some errors cannot be fixed or there is another error blocking it.\"\n    )  # pragma: no cover\n    return False  # pragma: no cover\n```\nThought: Users hope to have an option to limit the amount of output information when using the sqlfluff fix command, similar to the output behavior when using black in the pre-commit hook. The purpose is to hide the long list of repairs applied when repairing SQL files, making the output more concise. In the do_fixes function, there are multiple click.echo() calls used to output progress and result messages on the command line. In response to the issue's request, which is to implement a silent mode with less or no output in the CLI, it is necessary to modify this function so that the output can be controlled and the information will only be displayed when necessary. It should be noted that other related functions may need to be modified.\nResult: Thus the probability score that this code needs to be modified to solve this issue is 8.\n\nIssue: Bug within scaling.py wavelet calculation methodology\n**Describe the bug**\r\nMathematical error within the wavelet computation for the scaling.py WVM implementation. Error arises from the methodology, as opposed to just a software bug. \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n```\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nfrom pvlib import scaling\r\ncs = np.random.rand(2**14)\r\nw, ts = scaling._compute_wavelet(cs,1)\r\nprint(np.all( (sum(w)-cs) < 1e-8 ))  # Returns False, expect True\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nFor a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) the sum of all wavelet modes should equate to the original data. \r\n\r\n**Versions:**\r\n - ``pvlib.__version__``: 0.7.2\r\n - ``pandas.__version__``: 1.2.3\r\n - python: 3.8.8\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThis bug is also present in the [PV_LIB](https://pvpmc.sandia.gov/applications/wavelet-variability-model/) Matlab version that was used as the basis for this code (I did reach out to them using the PVLIB MATLAB email form, but don't know who actually wrote that code). Essentially, the existing code throws away the highest level of Detail Coefficient in the transform and keeps an extra level of Approximation coefficient. The impact on the calculation is small, but leads to an incorrect DWT and reconstruction. I have a fix that makes the code pass the theoretical test about the DWT proposed under 'To Reproduce' but there may be some question as to whether this should be corrected or left alone to match the MATLAB code it was based on.\nCode:\n```\n# top-level method _compute_wavelet in pvlib/scaling.py file\ndef _compute_wavelet(clearsky_index, dt=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute the wavelet transform on the input clear_sky time series.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    clearsky_index : numeric or pandas.Series\n        Clear Sky Index time series that will be smoothed.\n\n    dt : float, default None\n        The time series time delta.

This is because the prepare_inputs_from_poa function and prepare_inputs() function handle different input data and verification logic.\nResult: Thus the probability score that this code needs to be modified to solve this issue is 1.\n\nIssue: Enable quiet mode/no-verbose in CLI for use in pre-commit hook\nThere seems to be only an option to increase the level of verbosity when using SQLFluff [CLI], not to limit it further.\r\n\r\nIt would be great to have an option to further limit the amount of prints when running `sqlfluff fix`, especially in combination with deployment using a pre-commit hook. For example, only print the return status and the number of fixes applied, similar to how it is when using `black` in a pre-commit hook:\r\n\r\nThis hides the potentially long list of fixes that are being applied to the SQL files, which can get quite verbose.\nCode:\n```\n# top-level method do_fixed in src/sqlfluff/cli/commands.py file\ndef do_fixes(lnt, result, formatter=None, **kwargs):\n    \"\"\"Actually do the fixes.\"\"\"\n    click.echo(\"Persisting Changes...\")\n    res = result.persist_changes(formatter=formatter, **kwargs)\n    if all(res.values()):\n        click.echo(\"Done.

The purpose is to hide the long list of repairs applied when repairing SQL files, making the output more concise. In the do_fixes function, there are multiple click.echo() calls used to output progress and result messages on the command line. In response to the issue's request, which is to implement a silent mode with less or no output in the CLI, it is necessary to modify this function so that the output can be controlled and the information will only be displayed when necessary. It should be noted that other related functions may need to be modified.\nResult: Thus the probability score that this code needs to be modified to solve this issue is 8.\n\nIssue: Bug within scaling.py wavelet calculation methodology\n**Describe the bug**\r\nMathematical error within the wavelet computation for the scaling.py WVM implementation. Error arises from the methodology, as opposed to just a software bug. \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n```\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nfrom pvlib import scaling\r\ncs = np.random.rand(2**14)\r\nw, ts = scaling._compute_wavelet(cs,1)\r\nprint(np.all( (sum(w)-cs) < 1e-8 ))  # Returns False, expect True\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nFor a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) the sum of all wavelet modes should equate to the original data. \r\n\r\n**Versions:**\r\n - ``pvlib.__version__``: 0.7.2\r\n - ``pandas.__version__``: 1.2.3\r\n - python: 3.8.8\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThis bug is also present in the [PV_LIB](https://pvpmc.sandia.gov/applications/wavelet-variability-model/) Matlab version that was used as the basis for this code (I did reach out to them using the PVLIB MATLAB email form, but don't know who actually wrote that code). Essentially, the existing code throws away the highest level of Detail Coefficient in the transform and keeps an extra level of Approximation coefficient. The impact on the calculation is small, but leads to an incorrect DWT and reconstruction. I have a fix that makes the code pass the theoretical test about the DWT proposed under 'To Reproduce' but there may be some question as to whether this should be corrected or left alone to match the MATLAB code it was based on.\nCode:\n```\n# top-level method _compute_wavelet in pvlib/scaling.py file\ndef _compute_wavelet(clearsky_index, dt=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute the wavelet transform on the input clear_sky time series.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    clearsky_index : numeric or pandas.Series\n        Clear Sky Index time series that will be smoothed.\n\n    dt : float, default None\n        The time series time delta.

Theoretically, for discrete wavelet transform (DWT), the sum of all wavelet modes should be equal to the original data. However, during testing it was found that this reconstruction condition was not met. To resolve this issue, a fundamental change in the implementation of the _compute_wavelet function is required.\nResult: Thus the probability score that this code needs to be modified to solve this issue is 10.\n\n# Now the issue is:\n<issue>sympy.polys.factortools.dmp_zz_mignotte_bound improvement\nThe method `dup_zz_mignotte_bound(f, K)` can be significantly improved by using the **Knuth-Cohen bound** instead. After our research with Prof. Ag.Akritas we have implemented the Knuth-Cohen bound among others, and compare them among dozens of polynomials with different degree, density and coefficients range. Considering the results and the feedback from Mr.Kalevi Suominen, our proposal is that the mignotte_bound should be replaced by the knuth-cohen bound.\nAlso, `dmp_zz_mignotte_bound(f, u, K)` for mutli-variants polynomials should be replaced appropriately.\n</issue>\nCode:\n```\n# class_function method _eval_integral in Integral class in sympy/integrals/integrals.py file\n    def _eval_integral(self, f, x, meijerg=None, risch=None, manual=None,\n                       heurisch=None, conds='piecewise'):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculate the anti-derivative to the function f(x).\n\n        The following algorithms are applied (roughly in this order):\n\n        1. Simple heuristics (based on pattern matching and integral table):\n\n           - most frequently used functions (e.g. polynomials, products of\n             trig functions)\n\n        2. Integration of rational functions:\n\n           - A complete algorithm for integrating rational functions is\n             implemented (the Lazard-Rioboo-Trager algorithm).  The algorithm\n             also uses the partial fraction decomposition algorithm\n             implemented in apart() as a preprocessor to make this process\n             faster.  Note that the integral of a rational function is always\n             elementary, but in general, it may include a RootSum.\n\n        3. Full Risch algorithm:\n\n           - The Risch algorithm is a complete decision\n             procedure for integrating elementary functions, which means that\n             given any elementary function, it will either compute an\n             elementary antiderivative, or else prove that none exists.\n             Currently, part of transcendental case is implemented, meaning\n             elementary integrals containing exponentials, logarithms, and\n             (soon!) trigonometric functions can be computed.  The algebraic\n             case, e.g., functions containing roots, is much more difficult\n             and is not implemented yet.\n\n           - If the routine fails (because the integrand is not elementary, or\n             because a case is not implemented yet), it continues on to the\n             next algorithms below.  If the routine proves that the integrals\n             is nonelementary, it still moves on to the algorithms below,\n             because we might be able to find a closed-form solution in terms\n             of special functions.  If risch=True, however, it will stop here.\n\n        4. The Meijer G-Function algorithm:\n\n           - This algorithm works by first rewriting the integrand in terms of\n             very general Meijer G-Function (meijerg in SymPy), integrating\n             it, and then rewriting the result back, if possible.  This\n             algorithm is particularly powerful for definite integrals (which\n             is actually part of a different method of Integral), since it can\n             compute closed-form solutions of definite integrals even when no\n             closed-form indefinite integral exists.  But it also is capable\n             of computing many indefinite integrals as well.\n\n           - Another advantage of this method is that it can use some results\n             about the Meijer G-Function to give a result in terms of a\n             Piecewise expression, which allows to express conditionally\n             convergent integrals.\n\n           - Setting meijerg=True will cause integrate() to use only this\n             method.\n\n        5. The \"manual integration\" algorithm:\n\n           - This algorithm tries to mimic how a person would find an\n             antiderivative by hand, for example by looking for a\n             substitution or applying integration by parts. This algorithm\n             does not handle as many integrands but can return results in a\n             more familiar form.\n\n           - Sometimes this algorithm can evaluate parts of an integral; in\n             this case integrate() will try to evaluate the rest of the\n             integrand using the other methods here.\n\n           - Setting manual=True will cause integrate() to use only this\n             method.\n\n        6. The Heuristic Risch algorithm:\n\n           - This is a heuristic version of the Risch algorithm, meaning that\n             it is not deterministic.  This is tried as a last resort because\n             it can be very slow.  It is still used because not enough of the\n             full Risch algorithm is implemented, so that there are still some\n             integrals that can only be computed using this method.  The goal\n             is to implement enough of the Risch and Meijer G-function methods\n             so that this can be deleted.\n\n             Setting heurisch=True will cause integrate() to use only this\n             method.

Then at the last line conclude \"Thus the probability score that this code needs to be modified to solve this issue is s\", where s is an integer between 1 and 10.\n\n# Examples\nIssue: ModelChain.prepare_inputs can succeed with missing dhi\nFrom the docstring for `ModelChain.prepare_inputs()` I believe the method should fail if `weather` does not have a `dhi` column.\r\n\r\nThe validation checks for `'ghi'` twice, but not `'dhi`.\nCode: \n```\n# class-function method prepare_inputs_from_poa in pvlib/modelchain.py\ndef prepare_inputs_from_poa(self, data):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prepare the solar position, irradiance and weather inputs to\n    the model, starting with plane-of-array irradiance.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    data : DataFrame\n        Contains plane-of-array irradiance data. Required column names\n        include ``'poa_global'``, ``'poa_direct'`` and ``'poa_diffuse'``.\n        Columns with weather-related data are ssigned to the\n        ``weather`` attribute.  If columns for ``'temp_air'`` and\n        ``'wind_speed'`` are not provided, air temperature of 20 C and wind\n        speed of 0 m/s are assumed.\n\n    Notes\n    -----\n    Assigns attributes: ``weather``, ``total_irrad``, ``solar_position``,\n    ``airmass``, ``aoi``.\n\n    See also\n    --------\n    pvlib.modelchain.ModelChain.prepare_inputs\n    \"\"\"\n\n    self._assign_weather(data)\n\n    self._verify_df(data, required=['poa_global', 'poa_direct',\n                                        'poa_diffuse'])\n    self._assign_total_irrad(data)\n\n    self._prep_inputs_solar_pos()\n    self._prep_inputs_airmass()\n\n    if isinstance(self.system, SingleAxisTracker):\n        self._prep_inputs_tracking()\n    else:\n        self._prep_inputs_fixed()\n\n    return self\n```\nThought: To solve the verification problem in the ModelChain.prepare_inputs() method mentioned in the issue, we do not need to modify the prepare_inputs_from_poa function, but should focus on ModelChain.prepare_inputs() itself. This is because the prepare_inputs_from_poa function and prepare_inputs() function handle different input data and verification logic.\nResult: Thus the probability score that this code needs to be modified to solve this issue is 1.\n\nIssue: Enable quiet mode/no-verbose in CLI for use in pre-commit hook\nThere seems to be only an option to increase the level of verbosity when using SQLFluff [CLI], not to limit it further.\r\n\r\nIt would be great to have an option to further limit the amount of prints when running `sqlfluff fix`, especially in combination with deployment using a pre-commit hook. For example, only print the return status and the number of fixes applied, similar to how it is when using `black` in a pre-commit hook:\r\n\r\nThis hides the potentially long list of fixes that are being applied to the SQL files, which can get quite verbose.\nCode:\n```\n# top-level method do_fixed in src/sqlfluff/cli/commands.py file\ndef do_fixes(lnt, result, formatter=None, **kwargs):\n    \"\"\"Actually do the fixes.\"\"\"\n    click.echo(\"Persisting Changes...\")\n    res = result.persist_changes(formatter=formatter, **kwargs)\n    if all(res.values()):\n        click.echo(\"Done. Please check your files to confirm.\")\n        return True\n    # If some failed then return false\n    click.echo(\n        \"Done. Some operations failed. Please check your files to confirm.\"\n    )  # pragma: no cover\n    click.echo(\n        \"Some errors cannot be fixed or there is another error blocking it.\"\n    )  # pragma: no cover\n    return False  # pragma: no cover\n```\nThought: Users hope to have an option to limit the amount of output information when using the sqlfluff fix command, similar to the output behavior when using black in the pre-commit hook. The purpose is to hide the long list of repairs applied when repairing SQL files, making the output more concise. In the do_fixes function, there are multiple click.echo() calls used to output progress and result messages on the command line.

The purpose is to hide the long list of repairs applied when repairing SQL files, making the output more concise.

In\n       practical calculations the summation in the deepest nested level must be\n       calculated first so that the outer expression can access the resulting\n       indexed object.\n\n    Examples\n    ========\n\n    >>> from sympy.tensor.index_methods import get_contraction_structure\n    >>> from sympy import symbols, default_sort_key\n    >>> from sympy.tensor import IndexedBase, Idx\n    >>> x, y, A = map(IndexedBase, ['x', 'y', 'A'])\n    >>> i, j, k, l = map(Idx, ['i', 'j', 'k', 'l'])\n    >>> get_contraction_structure(x[i]*y[i] + A[j, j])\n    {(i,): {x[i]*y[i]}, (j,): {A[j, j]}}\n    >>> get_contraction_structure(x[i]*y[j])\n    {None: {x[i]*y[j]}}\n\n    A multiplication of contracted factors results in nested dicts representing\n    the internal contractions.\n\n    >>> d = get_contraction_structure(x[i, i]*y[j, j])\n    >>> sorted(d.keys(), key=default_sort_key)\n    [None, x[i, i]*y[j, j]]\n\n    In this case, the product has no contractions:\n\n    >>> d[None]\n    {x[i, i]*y[j, j]}\n\n    Factors are contracted \"first\":\n\n    >>> sorted(d[x[i, i]*y[j, j]], key=default_sort_key)\n    [{(i,): {x[i, i]}}, {(j,): {y[j, j]}}]\n\n    A parenthesized Add object is also returned as a nested dictionary.  The\n    term containing the parenthesis is a Mul with a contraction among the\n    arguments, so it will be found as a key in the result.

This is because the prepare_inputs_from_poa function and prepare_inputs() function handle different input data and verification logic.\nResult: Thus the probability score that this code needs to be modified to solve this issue is 1.\n\nIssue: Enable quiet mode/no-verbose in CLI for use in pre-commit hook\nThere seems to be only an option to increase the level of verbosity when using SQLFluff [CLI], not to limit it further.\r\n\r\nIt would be great to have an option to further limit the amount of prints when running `sqlfluff fix`, especially in combination with deployment using a pre-commit hook. For example, only print the return status and the number of fixes applied, similar to how it is when using `black` in a pre-commit hook:\r\n\r\nThis hides the potentially long list of fixes that are being applied to the SQL files, which can get quite verbose.\nCode:\n```\n# top-level method do_fixed in src/sqlfluff/cli/commands.py file\ndef do_fixes(lnt, result, formatter=None, **kwargs):\n    \"\"\"Actually do the fixes.\"\"\"\n    click.echo(\"Persisting Changes...\")\n    res = result.persist_changes(formatter=formatter, **kwargs)\n    if all(res.values()):\n        click.echo(\"Done. Please check your files to confirm.\")\n        return True\n    # If some failed then return false\n    click.echo(\n        \"Done. Some operations failed. Please check your files to confirm.\"\n    )  # pragma: no cover\n    click.echo(\n        \"Some errors cannot be fixed or there is another error blocking it.\"\n    )  # pragma: no cover\n    return False  # pragma: no cover\n```\nThought: Users hope to have an option to limit the amount of output information when using the sqlfluff fix command, similar to the output behavior when using black in the pre-commit hook. The purpose is to hide the long list of repairs applied when repairing SQL files, making the output more concise. In the do_fixes function, there are multiple click.echo() calls used to output progress and result messages on the command line. In response to the issue's request, which is to implement a silent mode with less or no output in the CLI, it is necessary to modify this function so that the output can be controlled and the information will only be displayed when necessary. It should be noted that other related functions may need to be modified.\nResult: Thus the probability score that this code needs to be modified to solve this issue is 8.\n\nIssue: Bug within scaling.py wavelet calculation methodology\n**Describe the bug**\r\nMathematical error within the wavelet computation for the scaling.py WVM implementation. Error arises from the methodology, as opposed to just a software bug. \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n```\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nfrom pvlib import scaling\r\ncs = np.random.rand(2**14)\r\nw, ts = scaling._compute_wavelet(cs,1)\r\nprint(np.all( (sum(w)-cs) < 1e-8 ))  # Returns False, expect True\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nFor a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) the sum of all wavelet modes should equate to the original data. \r\n\r\n**Versions:**\r\n - ``pvlib.__version__``: 0.7.2\r\n - ``pandas.__version__``: 1.2.3\r\n - python: 3.8.8\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThis bug is also present in the [PV_LIB](https://pvpmc.sandia.gov/applications/wavelet-variability-model/) Matlab version that was used as the basis for this code (I did reach out to them using the PVLIB MATLAB email form, but don't know who actually wrote that code). Essentially, the existing code throws away the highest level of Detail Coefficient in the transform and keeps an extra level of Approximation coefficient. The impact on the calculation is small, but leads to an incorrect DWT and reconstruction. I have a fix that makes the code pass the theoretical test about the DWT proposed under 'To Reproduce' but there may be some question as to whether this should be corrected or left alone to match the MATLAB code it was based on.\nCode:\n```\n# top-level method _compute_wavelet in pvlib/scaling.py file\ndef _compute_wavelet(clearsky_index, dt=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute the wavelet transform on the input clear_sky time series.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    clearsky_index : numeric or pandas.Series\n        Clear Sky Index time series that will be smoothed.\n\n    dt : float, default None\n        The time series time delta.

Theoretically, for discrete wavelet transform (DWT), the sum of all wavelet modes should be equal to the original data. However, during testing it was found that this reconstruction condition was not met. To resolve this issue, a fundamental change in the implementation of the _compute_wavelet function is required.\nResult: Thus the probability score that this code needs to be modified to solve this issue is 10.\n\n# Now the issue is:\n<issue>collect_factor_and_dimension does not detect equivalent dimensions in addition\nCode to reproduce:\n```python\nfrom sympy.physics import units\nfrom sympy.physics.units.systems.si import SI\nv1 = units.Quantity('v1')\nSI.set_quantity_dimension(v1, units.velocity)\nSI.set_quantity_scale_factor(v1, 2 * units.meter / units.second)\na1 = units.Quantity('a1')\nSI.set_quantity_dimension(a1, units.acceleration)\nSI.set_quantity_scale_factor(a1, -9.8 * units.meter / units.second**2)\nt1 = units.Quantity('t1')\nSI.set_quantity_dimension(t1, units.time)\nSI.set_quantity_scale_factor(t1, 5 * units.second)\nexpr1 = a1*t1 + v1\nSI._collect_factor_and_dimension(expr1)\n```\nResults in:\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nFile \"C:\\Python\\Python310\\lib\\site-packages\\sympy\\physics\\units\\unitsystem.py\", line 179, in _collect_factor_and_dimension\nraise ValueError(\nValueError: Dimension of \"v1\" is Dimension(velocity), but it should be Dimension(acceleration*time)\n```\n</issue>\nCode:\n```\n# top-level function method wigner_6j in sympy/physics/wigner.py file\ndef wigner_6j(j_1, j_2, j_3, j_4, j_5, j_6, prec=None):\n    r\"\"\"\n    Calculate the Wigner 6j symbol `\\operatorname{Wigner6j}(j_1,j_2,j_3,j_4,j_5,j_6)`.\n\n    Parameters\n    ==========\n\n    j_1, ..., j_6 :\n        Integer or half integer.\n    prec :\n        Precision, default: ``None``.

Then at the last line conclude \"Thus the probability score that this code needs to be modified to solve this issue is s\", where s is an integer between 1 and 10.\n\n# Examples\nIssue: ModelChain.prepare_inputs can succeed with missing dhi\nFrom the docstring for `ModelChain.prepare_inputs()` I believe the method should fail if `weather` does not have a `dhi` column.\r\n\r\nThe validation checks for `'ghi'` twice, but not `'dhi`.\nCode: \n```\n# class-function method prepare_inputs_from_poa in pvlib/modelchain.py\ndef prepare_inputs_from_poa(self, data):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prepare the solar position, irradiance and weather inputs to\n    the model, starting with plane-of-array irradiance.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    data : DataFrame\n        Contains plane-of-array irradiance data. Required column names\n        include ``'poa_global'``, ``'poa_direct'`` and ``'poa_diffuse'``.\n        Columns with weather-related data are ssigned to the\n        ``weather`` attribute.  If columns for ``'temp_air'`` and\n        ``'wind_speed'`` are not provided, air temperature of 20 C and wind\n        speed of 0 m/s are assumed.\n\n    Notes\n    -----\n    Assigns attributes: ``weather``, ``total_irrad``, ``solar_position``,\n    ``airmass``, ``aoi``.\n\n    See also\n    --------\n    pvlib.modelchain.ModelChain.prepare_inputs\n    \"\"\"\n\n    self._assign_weather(data)\n\n    self._verify_df(data, required=['poa_global', 'poa_direct',\n                                        'poa_diffuse'])\n    self._assign_total_irrad(data)\n\n    self._prep_inputs_solar_pos()\n    self._prep_inputs_airmass()\n\n    if isinstance(self.system, SingleAxisTracker):\n        self._prep_inputs_tracking()\n    else:\n        self._prep_inputs_fixed()\n\n    return self\n```\nThought: To solve the verification problem in the ModelChain.prepare_inputs() method mentioned in the issue, we do not need to modify the prepare_inputs_from_poa function, but should focus on ModelChain.prepare_inputs() itself. This is because the prepare_inputs_from_poa function and prepare_inputs() function handle different input data and verification logic.\nResult: Thus the probability score that this code needs to be modified to solve this issue is 1.\n\nIssue: Enable quiet mode/no-verbose in CLI for use in pre-commit hook\nThere seems to be only an option to increase the level of verbosity when using SQLFluff [CLI], not to limit it further.\r\n\r\nIt would be great to have an option to further limit the amount of prints when running `sqlfluff fix`, especially in combination with deployment using a pre-commit hook. For example, only print the return status and the number of fixes applied, similar to how it is when using `black` in a pre-commit hook:\r\n\r\nThis hides the potentially long list of fixes that are being applied to the SQL files, which can get quite verbose.\nCode:\n```\n# top-level method do_fixed in src/sqlfluff/cli/commands.py file\ndef do_fixes(lnt, result, formatter=None, **kwargs):\n    \"\"\"Actually do the fixes.\"\"\"\n    click.echo(\"Persisting Changes...\")\n    res = result.persist_changes(formatter=formatter, **kwargs)\n    if all(res.values()):\n        click.echo(\"Done. Please check your files to confirm.\")\n        return True\n    # If some failed then return false\n    click.echo(\n        \"Done. Some operations failed. Please check your files to confirm.\"\n    )  # pragma: no cover\n    click.echo(\n        \"Some errors cannot be fixed or there is another error blocking it.\"\n    )  # pragma: no cover\n    return False  # pragma: no cover\n```\nThought: Users hope to have an option to limit the amount of output information when using the sqlfluff fix command, similar to the output behavior when using black in the pre-commit hook. The purpose is to hide the long list of repairs applied when repairing SQL files, making the output more concise. In the do_fixes function, there are multiple click.echo() calls used to output progress and result messages on the command line. In response to the issue's request, which is to implement a silent mode with less or no output in the CLI, it is necessary to modify this function so that the output can be controlled and the information will only be displayed when necessary. It should be noted that other related functions may need to be modified.\nResult: Thus the probability score that this code needs to be modified to solve this issue is 8.\n\nIssue: Bug within scaling.py wavelet calculation methodology\n**Describe the bug**\r\nMathematical error within the wavelet computation for the scaling.py WVM implementation. Error arises from the methodology, as opposed to just a software bug. \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n```\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nfrom pvlib import scaling\r\ncs = np.random.rand(2**14)\r\nw, ts = scaling._compute_wavelet(cs,1)\r\nprint(np.all( (sum(w)-cs) < 1e-8 ))  # Returns False, expect True\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nFor a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) the sum of all wavelet modes should equate to the original data. \r\n\r\n**Versions:**\r\n - ``pvlib.__version__``: 0.7.2\r\n - ``pandas.__version__``: 1.2.3\r\n - python: 3.8.8\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThis bug is also present in the [PV_LIB](https://pvpmc.sandia.gov/applications/wavelet-variability-model/) Matlab version that was used as the basis for this code (I did reach out to them using the PVLIB MATLAB email form, but don't know who actually wrote that code). Essentially, the existing code throws away the highest level of Detail Coefficient in the transform and keeps an extra level of Approximation coefficient. The impact on the calculation is small, but leads to an incorrect DWT and reconstruction. I have a fix that makes the code pass the theoretical test about the DWT proposed under 'To Reproduce' but there may be some question as to whether this should be corrected or left alone to match the MATLAB code it was based on.\nCode:\n```\n# top-level method _compute_wavelet in pvlib/scaling.py file\ndef _compute_wavelet(clearsky_index, dt=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute the wavelet transform on the input clear_sky time series.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    clearsky_index : numeric or pandas.Series\n        Clear Sky Index time series that will be smoothed.\n\n    dt : float, default None\n        The time series time delta.

Theoretically, for discrete wavelet transform (DWT), the sum of all wavelet modes should be equal to the original data. However, during testing it was found that this reconstruction condition was not met. To resolve this issue, a fundamental change in the implementation of the _compute_wavelet function is required.\nResult: Thus the probability score that this code needs to be modified to solve this issue is 10.\n\n# Now the issue is:\n<issue>sympy.polys.factortools.dmp_zz_mignotte_bound improvement\nThe method `dup_zz_mignotte_bound(f, K)` can be significantly improved by using the **Knuth-Cohen bound** instead. After our research with Prof. Ag.Akritas we have implemented the Knuth-Cohen bound among others, and compare them among dozens of polynomials with different degree, density and coefficients range. Considering the results and the feedback from Mr.Kalevi Suominen, our proposal is that the mignotte_bound should be replaced by the knuth-cohen bound.\nAlso, `dmp_zz_mignotte_bound(f, u, K)` for mutli-variants polynomials should be replaced appropriately.\n</issue>\nCode:\n```\n# top-level function method get_contraction_structure in sympy/tensor/index_methods.py file\ndef get_contraction_structure(expr):\n    \"\"\"Determine dummy indices of ``expr`` and describe its structure\n\n    By *dummy* we mean indices that are summation indices.\n\n    The structure of the expression is determined and described as follows:\n\n    1) A conforming summation of Indexed objects is described with a dict where\n       the keys are summation indices and the corresponding values are sets\n       containing all terms for which the summation applies.  All Add objects\n       in the SymPy expression tree are described like this.\n\n    2) For all nodes in the SymPy expression tree that are *not* of type Add, the\n       following applies:\n\n       If a node discovers contractions in one of its arguments, the node\n       itself will be stored as a key in the dict.  For that key, the\n       corresponding value is a list of dicts, each of which is the result of a\n       recursive call to get_contraction_structure().  The list contains only\n       dicts for the non-trivial deeper contractions, omitting dicts with None\n       as the one and only key.\n\n    .. Note:: The presence of expressions among the dictionary keys indicates\n       multiple levels of index contractions.  A nested dict displays nested\n       contractions and may itself contain dicts from a deeper level.  In\n       practical calculations the summation in the deepest nested level must be\n       calculated first so that the outer expression can access the resulting\n       indexed object.\n\n    Examples\n    ========\n\n    >>> from sympy.tensor.index_methods import get_contraction_structure\n    >>> from sympy import symbols, default_sort_key\n    >>> from sympy.tensor import IndexedBase, Idx\n    >>> x, y, A = map(IndexedBase, ['x', 'y', 'A'])\n    >>> i, j, k, l = map(Idx, ['i', 'j', 'k', 'l'])\n    >>> get_contraction_structure(x[i]*y[i] + A[j, j])\n    {(i,): {x[i]*y[i]}, (j,): {A[j, j]}}\n    >>> get_contraction_structure(x[i]*y[j])\n    {None: {x[i]*y[j]}}\n\n    A multiplication of contracted factors results in nested dicts representing\n    the internal contractions.\n\n    >>> d = get_contraction_structure(x[i, i]*y[j, j])\n    >>> sorted(d.keys(), key=default_sort_key)\n    [None, x[i, i]*y[j, j]]\n\n    In this case, the product has no contractions:\n\n    >>> d[None]\n    {x[i, i]*y[j, j]}\n\n    Factors are contracted \"first\":\n\n    >>> sorted(d[x[i, i]*y[j, j]], key=default_sort_key)\n    [{(i,): {x[i, i]}}, {(j,): {y[j, j]}}]\n\n    A parenthesized Add object is also returned as a nested dictionary.  The\n    term containing the parenthesis is a Mul with a contraction among the\n    arguments, so it will be found as a key in the result.
